Reference zones are similar to reference lines, except that it marks out an entire zone rather than just a line. Reference zones help you identify data plots that fall under the zone. In FusionCharts.NET, a reference zone has two fixed values filled by a color. You can use `n` number of reference zones in a canvas.

Refer to the image below:

The salient features of a reference zone are:

- You can specify a minimum value and a maximum value to draw a reference zone.

- You can create one or more reference zones on canvas for each y-axis (in case the chart has multiple y-axes).

- You can customize the color and other cosmetic properties to each reference zone.

- When you hover over the reference zone, the data plots falling in the zone get highlighted.

## Configure Reference Zone

To include a reference zone in a chart, you need to use the `ReferenceZone` object under `YAxes` object.

After that, follow the steps to set the max, min value of the reference zone:

- Use the `Value` property to set the value of the reference zone.

- Use the `Max` property to set the value up to which you want to create the reference zone.

- Use the `Min` property to set the value from where you want to create the reference zone.

- Use the `Label` property to set the text of the label.

Refer to the code given below:

```csharp
vizObj.YAxes.ReferenceZone.Value = 20000;
vizObj.YAxes.ReferenceZone.Min = 10000;
vizObj.YAxes.ReferenceZone.Max = 150000
vizObj.YAxes.ReferenceZone.Label = "sample 1";
```

A reference zone in a time-series chart looks like as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart temperature-reading-line-plot-reference-zone %}

The code to add multiple reference zone to your chart is given below:

```csharp
vizObj.YAxes.ReferenceZone.AddNew();
```

In the above code, firstly you invoke the `AddNew()` method and then set the above mentioned properties.
