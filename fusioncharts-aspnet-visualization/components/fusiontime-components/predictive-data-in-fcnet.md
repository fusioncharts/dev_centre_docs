Forecasting has always been an important aspect of time-series data representation and with FusionCharts.NET v1.0.7 we want to ensure that our library has the capability to represent predictive data values.

The product does not forecast values right now; it just represents the data which are predicted (once specified) differently.

To represent your predicted data in different styles, FusionCharts.NET allows you to specify the date (from the data you will use) beyond which the rendered data will have styling different from the default rendered data plots.

Refer to the image below:

## Configure Predictive Data

To add predictive data in a chart, you need to use the `PredictiveData` object under `vizObj` object. To specify the predictive data to a chart, use the `PredictionDate` object under `PredictiveData` object.

Refer to the code given below:

```csharp
vizObj.PredictiveData.PredictionDate = new DateTime(2018, 2, 1);
```

The chart looks like as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart predictive-data-in-fusiontime %}
