The legend is a chart element that you can use to display the name and color of a data series. It also allows you to interact with different data series when your chart data has more than one data series. This helps you relate a data plot to its series name using its color.

In the image given below, you can see the legend in a chart labeled:

## Customize a Legend

You can customize a legend by assigning custom values to different properties of the `Legend` object in an object:

### Show/Hide Legend

To hide the legend, set the value of the `Show` properties to `false`. Refer to the code given below:

```
visualizationObj.Legend.Show = false;
```

### Set Legend Title

Set the title of the legend as string using the `Text` properties. Refer to the code given below:

```csharp
visualizationObj.Legend.Caption = "column chart Legend section";
```

### Set Legend Position

Set the position of the legend as `BOTTOM` or `RIGHT` using the `Position` properties. Refer to the code given below:

```
visualizationObj.Legend.Position = LegendObject.LegendPosition.Bottom;|
```

### Customize Font Properties

Customize the font properties of the legend title using the following:

- Set the font size as an integer using the `FontSize` properties.
- Set the font type as string using the `FontName` properties.
- Set the font color as hex code using the `FontColor` properties.
- Display the title as bold by setting the `Bold` properties to `true`.

Refer to the code given below:

```
visualizationObj.Legend.FontSize = 16;
visualizationObj.Legend.FontName = "Arial";
