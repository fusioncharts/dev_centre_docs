title: Drawing Regression Lines in the Zoom-scatter Chart
chartPresent: true
---

A regression line, rendered as a straight line, is used to show the trend of __y__ values with respect to the __x__ values or the trend of __x__ values with respect to the __y__ values. A regression line, therefore, can be used to derive a particular trend from the scattered data points in the chart canvas and predict values accordingly. For example, regression lines can be used to find trends and predict future sales, stock prices, currency exchange rates, productivity gains resulting from a training program, and so on.

There are several methods to calculate and draw regression lines; the zoom-scatter chart, using linear regression, uses the __least-squares__ deviation method (also known as the least absolute deviation method). This method calculates the best-fitting straight-line for the observed data by minimizing the sum of the squares of the vertical deviation of each data point from the line (if a point lies on the fitted line exactly, then its vertical deviation is 0). As the deviation values are first squared and then summed, there are no cancellations between positive and negative values.

A zoom-scatter chart rendered with regression lines is shown below:

{% embed_chart {"source": "drawing-regression-lines-in-the-zoom-scatter-chart-example-1.js", "id": "1"} %}

Given below is a brief description of the attribute used to show regression lines:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`showRegressionLine`</td>
    <td>It is used to specify whether a regression line will be shown for the chart. Setting this attribute to `1` will show the regression line, setting it to `0` (default) will hide it. This attribute belongs to the `dataset` object.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Modes of Regression

Regression lines can be drawn in one of the following two modes:

*  **Y** on **X**: (Default  mode) Used when __y__ values are predicted, or a trend of __y__ values is calculated, based on the __x__ values

* **X** on **Y**: Used when __x__ values are predicted, or a trend of __x__ values is calculated, based on the __y__ values

In the zoom-scatter chart shown above, the regression lines are drawn in the **Y** on **X** mode. 

The same chart with the regression lines drawn using the **X on Y** mode looks like this:

{% embed_chart {"source": "drawing-regression-lines-in-the-zoom-scatter-chart-example-2.js", "id": "2"} %}

Given below is a brief description of the attributes used to set the mode and customize regression lines:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`showYOnX`</td>
    <td>It is used to specify the mode in which a regression line will be drawn. Setting this attribute to `0` will draw the regression lines in __X on Y__ mode , setting it to `1` (default) will draw the regression lines in __Y on X__ mode. This attribute belongs to the `dataset` object.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`regressionLineColor`</td>
    <td>It is used to specify the hex code of the color that will be used to draw the regression line. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`regressionLineThickness`</td>
    <td>It is used to specify the thickness of the regression line. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`regressionLineAlpha`</td>
    <td>It is used to specify the transparency of the regression line. This attribute takes values between `0` (transparent) and `100` (opaque).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The formulae used to draw the regression lines for both the modes are given below:

<br>

**Y on X**: The regression equation of **Y on X** is the equation of the best fitting straight line in the form __y=a+bx__, where __x__ is the explanatory variable and __y__ is the dependent variable and __b=(n . Σ (x.y) - (Σ x).(Σ y) )/ (n Σx² – (Σx)²)__.

<br>

**X on Y**: The regression equation of **X on Y** is the equation of the best fitting straight line in the form __x=a+by__, where __y__ is the explanatory variable and __x__ is the dependent variable and __b=(n . Σ (x.y) - (Σ x).(Σ y) )/ (n Σy² – (Σy)²)__.
