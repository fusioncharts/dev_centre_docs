As an example, we will create a spark column chart that shows the monthly revenue.

A spark column chart that shows the monthly revenue looks like this:

{% embed_all gauge-and-widgets-guide-spark-charts-creating-spark-column-chart-example-1.js %}

Given below is a brief description of the attribute used to create a simple spark column chart:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`value`</td>
    <td>It is used to show the numerical value for a data plot on the spark column chart, e.g. 783000. This attribute belongs to the `data` object, which in turn belongs to the `dataset` object.</td>
  </tr>
