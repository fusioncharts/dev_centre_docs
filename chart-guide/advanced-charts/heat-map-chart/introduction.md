A heat map chart is a specialized chart that uses colors to represent data values in a table. It is mostly used to plot large and complex data.

## Basics of Heat Map Charts

You can use the heat map chart to plot data like employee attendance, a periodic table, tracking investments in the stock market, comparing the performance of different companies, etc. You can set different colors for different levels of data. For example, you can use the heat map chart to plot the employee attendance and use the red, yellow, blue and green color to indicate a bad, average, good, and excellent, respectively, percentage of employee attendance. When the chart is rendered the four levels can be easily distinguished by their respective colors.
