## Introduction
> These chart types belong to **FusionWidgets XT**.

Spark charts are data-intensive, design-simple, word-sized graphics charts that you can embed in a context of words, numbers, and images.

Spark charts are succinct, memorable, and located right where they are discussed. You need to use these charts inline, which means that they are about the same height as the surrounding text. Use spark charts extensively in space-efficient executive dashboards to show a lot of KPIs within a single view.

## Salient Features

The major features of spark charts include the following:

* Configure trend-lines and trend-zones for the spark line and spark column charts

* Depict win, loss, and draw in the spark Win-Loss chart.

* Use predefined palettes and custom single color palettes.

* Use predefined themes.

* Use different colors for open, close, high/low plots.

* Show/hide open, close, high/low value.

* Show/hide open, close, high/low anchors.

* Highlight period length by showing colored background blocks.

* Customize period length.

* Use a different color for scoreless games in win-loss charts.

## Types of Spark Charts

With FusionCharts Suite XT, you can build three types of spark charts -

* Line
* Column
* Win/loss

## Create a Spark Line Chart

A spark line chart looks as follows:

{% embed_chartAnatomy spark-line-chart.json %}

To create a spark line chart follow the steps given below:

* In the JSON data, set the attributes and their corresponding values in `"<attributeName>": "<value>"` format.

* Specify the chart type using the `type` attribute. To render a spark line chart, set `sparkline`.

* Set the container object using `renderAt` attribute.

* Specify the dimension of the chart using `width` and `height` attributes.

* Set the type of data (JSON/XML) you want to pass to the chart object using `dataFormat` attribute.

* Set the `value` attribute within the `data` object to show the numerical value of the data.

* Set the `value` attribute within the `data` object to show the numerical value for a point on the spark line chart.

Refer to the code given below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        ...
    },
    "dataset": [{
        "data": [{
            "value": "38.42"

## Configure Period Blocks

Use the following attributes to show period blocks on the chart using colored bands, and easily interpret periods:

* Specify the number of data points that each period block will encapsulate, using the `periodLength` attribute.

* Specify the hex code for the color to be used to render the period block, using the `periodColor` attribute.

* Specify the transparency for the period block by setting the value of the `periodAlpha` attribute between `0` (transparent) and `100` (opaque).

Refer to the code below:

```json
{
    "chart": {      
        "periodlength": "3",
        "periodcolor": "#cccccc",
        "periodalpha": "90"
    },
}
```

The chart will look like the following:

> When configuring period blocks, ensure that the period length is always less than the number of data points that you have specified, as period length is directly numbered on data points.

## Configure Win/Loss and Draw Colors

Use the following attributes to configure the win, loss, and draw colors in the **Sparks Color Chart**:

* Specify the hex code of the fill color for the bars indicating win, using the `winColor` attribute.

* Specify the hex code of the fill color for the bars indicating loss, using the `lossColor` attribute.

* Specify the hex code of the fill color for the bars indicating draw, using the `drawColor` attribute.

Refer to the code below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        "winColor": "#00cc33",
        "lossColor": "#cc0000",
        "drawColor": "#0075c2"
    },
}
```

## Configure Colors to Show Scoreless Matches

To configure colors to show scoreless matches in the **Sparks Color Chart**, specify a fill color for the bars indicating a scoreless match, by setting the value of the `scoreLessColor` attribute's value to the color's hex code.

Refer to the code below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        "scoreLessColor": "#aa0000"
    },
}
```

```json
{
    "chart": {       
        "showValue": "1"

## Configure Hover Effects

Use the attributes mentioned below, to configure the hover effects for a spark win-loss chart:

* Set the value of the `winHoverColor` attribute to the hex code of the fill color of the `win` bar when you hover the mouse pointer over it.

* Set the value of the `lossHoverColor` attribute to the hex code of the fill color of the `loss` bar when you hover the mouse pointer over it.

* Set the value of the `drawHoverColor` attribute to the hex code of the fill color of the `draw` bar when you hover the mouse pointer over it.

* Set the value of the `scoreLessHoverColor` attribute to the hex code of the fill color of the `no score` bar when you hover the mouse pointer over it.

Refer to the code below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        "winHoverColor": "#49b6fe",
        "lossHoverColor": "#55e395",
        "drawHoverColor": "#ba9803",
        "scoreLessHoverColor": "#cccccc"
