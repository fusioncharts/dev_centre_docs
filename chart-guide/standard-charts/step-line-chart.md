A step line chart is used to visualize trends for a particular event which is not continuous in nature. It is a specialized line chart which, unlike the usual line charts, does not use the shortest distance to connect two data points; instead, it uses vertical and horizontal lines to connect the data points in a series to form a step-like progression.

Essentially, trends are quite apparent from the general slope of a line chart. However, when the lines take distorted shapes for a specific segment of data points, it becomes very difficult to determine the drift. This is where the significance of a step line chart comes in. For a given set of data, where a line chart shows the generic deviation of the data points, a step line chart not only enables you to compare the magnitude and change in values at different points of the same series but also helps you discern the intermittent pattern of the trend at the same time.

Let's create our first step line chart where we will compare the revenue earned with the expense incurred in the last year. The step-like composition of the data segments gives an accurate representation of the revenue and expense for each month.

To create a multi-series step line chart follow the steps given below:

* In the JSON data, set the attributes and their corresponding values in `"<attributeName>": "<value>"` format.

* Specify the chart type using the `type` attribute. To render a step-line chart, set `msstepline`.

* Set the container object using `renderAt` attribute.

* Specify the dimension of the chart using `width` and `height` attributes.

* Set the type of data (JSON/XML) you want to pass to the chart object using `dataFormat` attribute.

For a detailed list of attributes, refer to the [chart attributes]({% site.baseurl %}/chart-attributes?chart=msstepline "@@open-newtab") page of step-line chart.

A multi-series step line chart looks like this:

{% embed_all standard-charts-step-line-chart-example-1.js %}

> The data structure above is similar to that of any multi-series chart in the FusionCharts Suite XT, except for the **type** attribute.

## Hide the Vertical Lines

By default, the step line chart displays the vertical joins - vertical lines that run through the edges of the horizontal planes thereby joining them in different steps. However, you can also disjoin the horizontal segments by hiding the vertical lines from the chart.

To hide the vertical lines in your chart, set the `drawVerticalJoins` attribute to `0`. 

Refer to the code given below:

```
{
	"chart": {
		"drawVerticalJoins": "0"
	}
}

```
A step line chart rendered without the vertical joins looks like this:

{% embed_chart standard-charts-step-line-chart-example-2.js %}

## Use Forward Steps

For a step line chart, you can configure the direction of progression of the line segments. By default, the chart is rendered in the forward progressive mode - the line plots are horizontally depicted, and then vertical lines are drawn to connect the data plots. To disable the forward progressive mode, set the `useForwardSteps` attribute to `0`. 

Refer to the code given below:

```
{
	"chart": {
		"useForwardSteps": "0"
	},
}

```
A step line chart rendered with the forward progressive mode disabled looks like this:

{% embed_chart standard-charts-step-line-chart-example-3.js %}
