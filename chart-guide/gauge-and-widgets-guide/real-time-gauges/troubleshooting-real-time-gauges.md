Real time gauges are useful when you have to monitor the current value without considering historical values.

Here are a few problems that might come up with real time gauges, and the possible solutions:

## Problem 1: Gauge does not update in real time

If the real-time gauge is set up to receive data from the server and the gauge renders initially but does not update subsequently, ensure that:

* you have specified a valid path for the `dataStreamURL` attribute

* if the URL has special characters like `?` or `&`,  then URL-encode the `dataStreamURL`

* the `dataStreamURL` attribute returns correct data. To test this, run the URL on a separate page on your browser and it should return data in text format. Ensure the data returned does not contain carriage return (new-line characters) or HTML elements

* you have specified a valid value for the `refreshInterval` attribute

* the page that provides incremental data update to the gauges is hosted on the same sub-domain. For instance, a chart residing at "server1.mydomain.com" will not be able to access data from “mydomain.com”.

<p class="text-info"> To load data from a different domain, setup a proxy page at the sub-domain. The page will request data from the distant domain and relay it to the gauge. </p>

## Problem 2: Error accessing JavaScript API methods

When accessing any of the JavaScript API methods, if you get an error ` .. is not a function of`, ensure that:

* you are calling the JavaScript API method after the gauge has loaded and rendered.

* you have provided all the required .js files of the FusionCharts library and no other JavaScript error has occured.

* you are not rendering the gauge from the local file system (C:\ , D:). Instead, run it from a server (localhost - IIS or Apache) as the default security settings do not allow JavaScript interactions on the local file system, unless explicitly set.
