We will learn how to customize different properties of the canvas.

## Customize the Canvas Fill Color

To customize the canvas fill color, the following attributes are used:

* Specify the hex code of the canvas background color using the `showCanvasBorder` attribute.

* Set the transparency of the canvas background using the `canvasBgAlpha` attribute.

Refer to the code below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        "canvasbgColor": "#1790e1",
        "canvasbgAlpha": "10",
        "canvasBorderThickness": "1",
        "showAlternateHGridColor": "0",
        "bgColor": "#eeeeee"
    }
}
```

The chart will look like as shown below:

## Hide Canvas Border

By default, the canvas border is not visible. To show the canvas border, set the `showCanvasBorder` attribute to `1`.

Refer to the code below:

```
{
    "chart": {
        "showCanvasBorder":"1"
    }
}
```

The chart with canvas border will look like as shown below:

## Customize Canvas Border

To customize the border, the following attributes are used:

* Specify the hex code to set the border color using the `canvasBorderColor` attribute.

* Set the thickness of the border using the `canvasBorderThickness` attribute. Valid range is **0-5**.

* Set the transparency of the border using the `canvasBorderAlpha` attribute. 

Refer to the code below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        "canvasBorderColor":"'666666",
        "canvasBorderThickness":"4",
        "canvasBorderAlpha":"80"
    }
}
```

## Use Gradient Fill

To set gradient fill for the canvas follow the steps given below:

* Specify the hex codes of the gradient colors separated by a comma using the `canvasBgColor` attribute.

* Set the transparency of the background color using the `canvasBgAlpha` attribute.

* Set the canvas background ratio in percentage for gradients separated by a comma using the `canvasBgRatio` attribute.

* Specify canvas background angle (in degrees) in case of a gradient. Valid range is `0` to `360`.

Refer to the code below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        "canvasbgColor": "#eeeeee,#b3b3b3",
        "canvasbgAlpha": "100",
        "canvasBgRatio": "40,60",
        "canvasBgAngle": "0"
    }
}    
```

## Configure the 3D Effect

The canvas can be configured to have a 3D effect. To do so, follow the steps given below:

* Set the `showCanvasBg` attribute to `1` to show the canvas background. 

* Set the `showCanvasBase` attribute to `1` to show the canvas base.

* Specify the hex code of the base color using the `canvasBaseColor` attribute.

* Set the height of the canvas base using the `canvasBaseDepth` attribute.

* Set the depth of the canvas background using the `cnavsBgDepth` attribute.

Refer to the code below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        "showCanvasBg": "1",
        "showCanvasBase": "1",
        "canvasBaseDepth": "14",
        "canvasBgDepth": "5",
        "canvasBaseColor": "#aaaaaa",
        "canvasBgColor": "#eeeeee"
    }
}
```
