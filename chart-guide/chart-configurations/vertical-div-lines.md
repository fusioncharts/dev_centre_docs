## Introduction

Vertical divisional (or div) lines are a key feature in charts. They provide vertical markers that help to visually separate data points along the x-axis. These lines run vertically across the chart canvas, enhancing readability and making it easier to interpret the data.

Understanding how to render and customize **lineas vertical** dividers can significantly improve the clarity and aesthetic of your charts. In this blog, we will explore how to show vertical divisional lines, customize their appearance, use dashed lines, and display vertical grid bands for enhanced visualization.

> Vertical div lines are applicable only for the line, area, spline, splineArea, and XY type charts.

## Show Vertical Divisional Lines

By default, vertical divisional lines are not rendered in a chart. To render vertical divisional lines, specify the number of divisional lines you want to display using the `numVDivLines` attribute. 

Refer to the code below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        "numVDivLines": "5"
    }
}
```

The chart will look like as shown below:

## Customize the Visuals of Vertical Divisional Lines 

To customize the visuals of the divisional lines use the following attributes:

* Specify the hex code of for the divisional line color using the `vDivLineColor` attribute.

* Set the thickness (in pixels) using the `vDivLineThickness` attribute.

* Set the transparency of the using the `vDivLineAlpha` attribute.

Refer to the code below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        "numVDivLines": "5",
        "vDivLineColor": "#99ccff",
        "vDivLineThickness": "1",
        "vDivLineAlpha": "50"
    }
}
```

### Dashed Divisional Lines

You can also render div lines as dashed lines instead of the default continuous lines. To do so, use the following attributes:

* Set the `vDivLineDashed` attribute to `1` to view the divisional lines as dashed.

* Set the length of each dashed line using the `vDivLineDashLen` attribute.

* Set the gap between each dash using the `vDivLineDashGap` attribute.

Refer to the code below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        "numVDivLines": "5",
        "vDivLineColor": "#99ccff",
        "vDivLineThickness": "1",
        "vDivLineAlpha": "70",
        "vDivLineDashed": "1",
        "vDivLineDashLen": "5",
        "vDivLineDashGap": "3"
   }
}
```

## Show Vertical Grid Bands

Vertical grid bands, by default, do not appear between the vertical divisional lines. 

To show the vertical grid bands, set the `showAlternateVGridColor` attribute to `1`. 

Refer to the code below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        "showAlternateVGridColor": "1" 
    }
}
```
A line chart with alternate vertical grid bands enabled is shown below:

### Customize the Visuals Vertical Grid Bands

To customize the visual properties of the vertical grid bands use the following attributes:

* Specify the hex code for the color of the grid bands using the `alternateVGridColor` attribute.

* Set the transparency of the grid band using the `alternateVGridAlpha` attribute.

Refer to the code below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        "alternateVGridColor": "#bee6ff",
        "alternateVGridAlpha": "30"
    }
}    
```

## FAQs

### How to draw a vertical line in div?
When you need to draw a vertical line in a div, CSS comes to the rescue. By setting the border-left or border-right property, you can achieve this. For example, use border-left: 1px solid black to create a thin vertical line on the left side of the div. This practical method allows you to create a **vertical line graph** effect within your webpage, a valuable skill in your web development toolkit.

### How do I vertically divide a div?
To vertically divide a div, you can use the CSS border property or create multiple divs inside a parent div with specified widths and borders. This technique is useful for displaying a **vertical line graph** within a container. Here's an example:

```css
.divider {
border-left: 1px solid black;
height: 100%;
}
```

### What is the tag for the vertical line?</H3>
There isn't a specific HTML tag exclusively for vertical lines. However, you can create a vertical line using a styled div or the hr tag with CSS transformations. This approach allows you to create **vertical grid lines** or markers in your designs.

`<hr style="width: 1px; height: 200px; transform: rotate(90deg);">`
