Now, we will create an angular gauge for Harry so that he can quickly monitor the customer satisfaction score for Harry's SuperMart. Gauges are powerful tools that can showcase using a radial scale to display data, and a dial is used to indicate the value.

An angular/meter/dial gauge displays a specific dataset utilizing an indicator that moves within a circular range, to indicate whether the monitored data is within defined limits. You can select colors for the data range to suit your application such as green for satisfactory, yellow for caution and red for alarm.

Gauges, in FusionCharts Suite XT, are available as part of FusionWidget XT. To start with, we'll build a simple "Weekly Customer Satisfaction Index" gauge as shown below:

{% embed_chart getting-started-your-first-widget.js %}

Harry defines the thresholds for his customer satisfaction score using the following range.

Range|Color|Hex Code|
-|-|-
0-50|Red|#e44a00|
50-75|Yellow|#f8bd19|
75-100|Green|#6baa01|

So any score less than 50 is bad and is red. Any score between 50 and 75 is average and is yellow. Scores above 75 mean good and is green.

Let's now get to building the gauge. 

## Convert data to JSON/XML format

Here is the JSON/XML representation of the above data table to build this gauge:

{% embed_data getting-started-your-first-widget.js %}

### Include FusionCharts Suite XT library

To include the FusionCharts Suite XT JavaScript library in your HTML page, use the `<script>` tag. Next, include a theme file to style the chart. The theme is called fint (FusionCharts internal) and its .js file is present in the themes folder of your download. Refer to the code below:

```
<html>

<head>
    <title>My first gauge using FusionWidgets XT</title>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="fusioncharts/fusioncharts.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="fusioncharts/themes/fusioncharts.theme.fint.js"></script>
</head>

</html>

```

## Create a container for your gauge

Next, create a container for your chart in the form of a `<div>` element, as shown below:

```
<body>
  <div id="chart-container">An angular gauge will load here!</div>
</body>

```

This will allow to refer the `chart-container` id and render a gauge in this container.

## Create an instance of the gauge

In the final step, create an instance of an angular gauge, initialize it with the correct `width`, `height` and then set the JSON data source.

```
<script type="text/javascript">
    FusionCharts.ready(  function  () { 
        var  csatGauge =   new  FusionCharts({
            "type" :  "angulargauge",
            "renderAt" :  "chart-container",
            "width" :  "400",
            "height" :  "250",
            "dataFormat" :  "json",
            "dataSource" :  {
                "chart" :  {
                    "caption" :  "Customer Satisfaction Score",
                    "subcaption" :  "Last week",
                    "lowerLimit" :  "0",
                    "upperLimit" :  "100",
                    "theme" :  "fint"
                },
                "colorRange" :  {
                    "color" :  [{
                            "minValue" :  "0",
                            "maxValue" :  "50",
                            "code" :  "#e44a00"
                        },
                        {
                            "minValue" :  "50",
                            "maxValue" :  "75",
                            "code" :  "#f8bd19"
                        },
                        {
                            "minValue" :  "75",
                            "maxValue" :  "100",
                            "code" :  "#6baa01"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "dials" :  {
                    "dial" :  [{
                        "value" :  "67"
                    }]
                }
            }
        });

        csatGauge.render();
    });
</script>

```

In the above code:

* We created an instance of the `FusionCharts` object in the `csatGauge` variable. Here the instance we created was the `angularGauge` chart type. Each chart or gauge in your HTML page needs to have a separate variable. The initialization code is wrapped within the `FusionCharts.ready` method. This safeguards your chart instantiation code from being called before the FusionCharts Suite XT library is loaded and is ready to be used on the page.

* Next, we specified the dimensions of the gauge (in pixels) using the `width` and `height` property of the constructor.

* To specify the data format as JSON, we set the `dataFormat` parameter to json.

* The actual JSON data is embedded as the string value of the `dataSource` parameter. 

* The `chart` object contains a list of key-value pairs that lets you configure the functional and cosmetic attributes of your gauge. 

* The `colorrange` object lets you define different numeric ranges, each associated with a color, to indicate progressive thresholds. 

* The `dial` element specifies the properties and value for the dial.

* Please note, we have used the `theme` attribute in the chart's JSON data and provided `fint`(FusionCharts Suite XT Internal theme) as the value of it. Themes let you centralize your cosmetic and functional properties across various charts in your web application. FusionCharts Suite XT is shipped with three default themes - `ocean`, `zune` and `carbon`. You can also create your own themes, which we will learn in [Theme Manager](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/basic-chart-configurations/theme-manager.html).

* Call the `render` method to draw the gauge in chart-container `<div>` element.

That's it! You just created your first interactive JavaScript gauge using FusionCharts Suite XT.

                            {
                                "minValue" :  "75",
                                "maxValue" :  "100",

                        }]

        });
    </script>
</head>

<body>
    <div id="chart-container">An angular gauge will load here!</div>
</body>

</html>

```

Now view the page in a browser, you should see an interactive angular gauge, showing weekly customer satisfaction score for Harry's SuperMart.

## Problem rendering the gauge?

In case something went wrong, and you are unable to see the gauge, check the following:

* If you are getting a JavaScript error on your page, check your browser console for the exact error and fix accordingly.

* If the chart does not show up at all, but there are no JavaScript errors, check if the FusionCharts Suite XT JavaScript library has loaded correctly. You can use developer tools within your browser to see if `fusioncharts.js` was loaded. Check if the path to `fusioncharts.js` file is correct and whether the file exists in that location.

* If you get a **Loading Data** or **Error in loading data** message, check whether your JSON data structure is correct, and there are no conflicts related to quotation marks in your code.

Now that Harry can monitor his weekly customer satisfaction score using this gauge let's build a map to plot his sales across various states in the US.
