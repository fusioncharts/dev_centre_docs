Events are signals that let you execute specific actionsâ€”such as manipulating the DOM, sending data to the server to render the chart.

In this article, we'll discuss the events that you can use to trigger actions for different stages in the life cycle of a chart or when you interact with a chart.

## DataStore Events

### `itemsAdded`

This event is triggered when new row(s) are added to a DataTable in the DataStore.

> The sender argument contains the newly added rows, and the table `ID` of the `DataTable` in which the rows were added.

### `disposed`

This event is triggered when the entire `DataStore` is disposed.

## DataTable Events

### `updated`

This event is triggered when new column(s) are added to a `DataTable` in the DataStore.

### `disposed`

This event is triggered when the `DataTable` is disposed.
