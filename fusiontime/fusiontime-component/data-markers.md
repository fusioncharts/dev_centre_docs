Data marker in a chart represents an important event, which occurred on a specific data point. Hovering on a data marker shows an additional description of the event in the tooltip.

The image below shows the default data marker on a time series chart:

## Create Data Markers

To create data markers, follow the steps given below:

- Create a `dataMarker` object in the `dataSource`.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `time` attribute to set the time instance on which the data marker will be displayed.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `timeFormat` attribute to set the format of the date/time corresponding to the marker.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `type` attribute to define the type of the marker as `flag`.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `value` attribute to specify the y-axis label on which the data marker will be applied.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `identifier` attribute to set the character to be displayed within the marker.

- Within the `dataMarker` object use the `tooltext` attribute to set the text to be displayed in the tooltip, when you hover the mouse pointer over the data marker.

Refer to the code given below:

```javascript
dataMarker: [{
    series: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Mar-1980",
    identifier: "H",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "As a part of credit control program, under the leadership of Paul Volcker, the Fed tightened the money supply, allowing the federal fund rates to approach 20 percent."
}, {
    series: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Aug-1982",
    identifier: "L",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "The FED eases off the monetary brakes, allowing interest rates to fall and the economy to begin a strong recovery."
}, {
    series: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Oct-1987",
    identifier: "L",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "The FED is forced to ease rate after the stock market crash."
}, {
    series: "Interest Rate",
    time: "May-1989",
    identifier: "H",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "Liquidity problem forced the Fed to increase rate to nearly 10%."
}, {
    series: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Sept-1992",
    identifier: "L",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "To fight the jobless economy growth the Fed had to reduce the interest rate to 3%."
}, {
    series: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Jun-2003",
    identifier: "L",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "Struggling to revive the economy, the FED cuts it’s benchmark rate to 1%."
}, {
    series: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Sep-2007",
    identifier: "L",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "Fed started reducing the Federal Fund Rate."
}, {
    series: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Dec-2008",
    identifier: "L",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "Fed reduced the interest rates to sub 0.25% to manage the menace of longest economic downturn since World War 2"
}],
```

The data marker created using the above code is shown below:

{% embed_ftChart fusioncharts-aspnet-data-markers %}

There are currently two types of data markers:

- Flag type (default)
- Pin type

The pin type data marker has been introduced in FusionTime v1.3.0.

The image below shows the pin type data marker on a time series chart:

<img src="{% site.BASE_URL %}/images/fusiontime-component-data-markers-pin.png" alt="Data Markers" width="680" height="400">

The code to render a time series chart with `pin` type data marker is shown below:

```javascript
dataMarker: [
  {
    series: "Interest Rate",
    time: "Mar-1980",
    type: "pin", //data Marker set to pin
    identifier: "H",
    timeFormat: "%b-%Y",
    tooltext: "As a part of credit control program."
  }
];
```

A time-series chart with pin type data marker looks like as shown below:

## Data Markers in MultiVariate Chart

When representing time-series data, it is important to mark events which have happened on a particular set of data points at a specific time. In order to achieve this, FusionTime allows you to specify data markers for some specific canvases as well.

Let's take an example of the following data.

| Date       | Item   | Units Sold | Sales (USD) |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| 2020-1-1   | Cake   | 188        | 1880        |
| 2020-1-1   | Cookie | 133        | 339         |
| 2020-1-1   | Candy  | 121        | 84.7        |
| 2024-9-17  | Cake   | 2          | 20          |
| 2024-9-17  | Cookie | 277        | 831         |
| 2024-9-17  | Candy  | 219        | 153.3       |
| 2027-4-13  | Cake   | 168        | 1680        |
| 2027-4-13  | Cookie | 227        | 681         |
| 2027-4-13  | Candy  | 397        | 277.9       |
| 2029-12-31 | Cake   | 46         | 460         |
| 2029-12-31 | Cookie | 105        | 315         |
| 2029-12-31 | Candy  | 154        | 107.8       |

For the complete data click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusioncharts/dev_centre_docs/master/assets/datasources/fusiontime/fusioncharts-aspnet-data-markers/data.json).

Now, let’s add the events held on particular dates in the JSON using data markers. The code is shown below:

```json
{
  "caption": {
    "text": "La petite boulangerie"
  },
  "subcaption": {
    "text": "Units Sold and Sales over 10 years"
  },
  "series": "Item",
  "dataMarker": [
    {
      "time": "2024-9-17",
      "timeFormat": "%Y-%-m-%-d"
    },
    {
      "time": "2027-4-13",
      "timeFormat": "%Y-%-m-%-d"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the above code:

- `dataMarker` has been set under the `dataSource`.
- The `time` attribute specifies the date of the event held.
- the `timeFormat` attribute specifies the date/time format.

The chart looks as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart data-marker-multi-variate-sample-all-canvas %}

In the above chart, the data markers have been marked on both the canvases of the chart. There can be a case, where you want to apply a data marker to a particular canvas of a multivariate chart.

**For example:**

- The event occured on **2024-9-17** affects both the canvases, i.e., **Units Sold** and the **Sales** of **Cake**.
- The second event occured on **2027-3-28** affects on the canvas of **Units Sold** on both the items, i.e., **Candy** and **Cookie**.

To apply data marker to the chart for the above scenerio, let's create the data markers one after the other. Follow the steps below:

**Step 1**

Data marker on **2024-9-17** will only shown on the `series` for **Cake** and the `value` will be derived from **Units Sold**.

Refer to the code:

```json
{
  "time": "2024-9-17",
  "timeFormat": "%Y-%-m-%-d",
  "value": "Units Sold",
  "series": {
    "Item": "Cake"
  }
}
```

**Step 2**

Data marker on **2024-9-17** will only be shown on the `series` for **Cake** and the `value` will be derived from **Sales (USD)**.

Refer to the code:

```json
{
  "time": "2024-9-17",
  "timeFormat": "%Y-%-m-%-d",
  "value": "Sales (USD)",
  "series": {
    "Item": "Cake"
  }
}
```

**Step 3**

Data marker on **2027-4-13** will only be shown on the `series` for **Cookie** and the `value` will be derived from **Units Sold**.

Refer to the code:

```json
{
  "time": "2027-4-13",
  "timeFormat": "%Y-%-m-%-d",
  "value": "Units Sold",
  "series": {
    "Item": "Cookie"
  }
}
```

**Step 4**

Data marker on **2027-4-13** will only be shown on the `series` for **Candy** and the `value` will be derived from **Units Sold**.

Refer to the code:

```json
{
  "time": "2027-4-13",
  "timeFormat": "%Y-%-m-%-d",
  "value": "Units Sold",
  "series": {
    "Item": "Candy"
  }
}
```

The consolidated code of the above created data marker is:

```json
{
  "caption": {
    "text": "La petite boulangerie"
  },
  "subcaption": {
    "text": "Units Sold and Sales over 10 years"
  },
  "series": "Item",
  "dataMarker": [
    {
      "time": "2024-9-17",
      "timeFormat": "%Y-%-m-%-d",
      "tooltext": "Lowest units of Cake sold since cake decorator was fired.",
      "value": "Units Sold",
      "identifier": "C",
      "series": {
        "Item": "Cake"
      }
    },
    {
      "time": "2024-9-17",
      "timeFormat": "%Y-%-m-%-d",
      "tooltext": "Lowest sales of Cake since cake decorator was fired.",
      "value": "Sales (USD)",
      "identifier": "C",
      "series": {
        "Item": "Cake"
      }
    },
    {
      "time": "2027-4-13",
      "timeFormat": "%Y-%-m-%-d",
      "tooltext": "Units of Cookie sold affected by Candy discount.",
      "value": "Units Sold",
      "identifier": "K",
      "series": {
        "Item": "Cookie"
      }
    },
    {
      "time": "2027-4-13",
      "timeFormat": "%Y-%-m-%-d",
      "tooltext": "Max units of Candy sold since Candy discount started.",
      "value": "Units Sold",
      "identifier": "D",
      "series": {
        "Item": "Candy"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The chart looks as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart data-marker-multi-variate-sample %}

## Style Definition

You can add CSS styling to set the cosmetic properties of data markers. To set the styling, instead of creating a separate CSS file, you can define the styling using `StyleDefinition` object.

Now, let's define the `styleDefinition` object and set the **color** in an object. The code is given below:

```javascript
styleDefinition: {
    "colorstyle": {
        "fill": "#ff0000",
        "font-weight": "bold"
    }
}
```

Once the `StyleDefinition` is defined, you can refer it for the various components using `colorstyle` attribute.

The syntax to set the `StyleDefintion` to the data marker is given below:

```javascript
{
  "seriesName": String,
  "time": String,
  "timeFormat": String,
  "type": String,
  "identifier": Character
  "tooltext": String,
  "style": {
        "text": colorStyle,
        "marker": colorStyle
    }
}
```

In the above code, `colorStyle` object is called to set the color of the data marker.

The chart after applying the above attributes will look like as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart fusiontime-components-data-marker-style-definition %}

In the above sample, **font color** of the y-axis label has been changed.
