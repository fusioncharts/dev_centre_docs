FusionTime supports three types of data structures - single-series, multivariate, and multi-series. In the chart anatomy provided below, you can see the components of a single-series line chart.

{% embed_chartAnatomy ft-single-series-chart.json %}

Once you select the data structure that suits your data the best, you can choose the best plot type to go with it. The plot type of a chart refers to a line in a line chart, a column in a column chart, area in an area chart, etc.

FusionTime supports the following plot types:

- Line
- Column
- Stacked Column
- Grouped Column
- Area
- Stacked Area
- Smooth Area
- Spline
- Step Line
- Candlestick
- OHLC
- Range Series Charts
  - Column Range
  - Area Range

By default, the chart renders with a line plot. However, you can specify the plot type in a chart, using the `plotType` property inside the `yAxis` object. Refer to the code below:

```javascript
yAxis: {
    "plot": {
        "value": "Sales",
        "type": "column"
    }
}
```

In this article, we'll see different types of data plots to render a chart.

## Line

Let’s create a time series chart using line as a data plot showcasing online sales of SuperStore in United States of America.

The time series chart is shown below:

{% embed_ftChart online-sales-single-series %}

## Column

To render a time series chart with **column** as data plot, set the value of `type` attribute to `column`.

The above time series chart, rendered with column plot is shown below:

{% embed_ftChart online-sales-single-series-column-data-plot %}

## Stacked Column

To render a time series chart with the stacked column as data plot, set the value of `type` attribute to `column` and the value of the `series` to the y-axis value.

Let’s create a chart showcasing **Unemployment rate in San Jose & SJ Metro Area**.

{% embed_ftChart stacked-column-chart %}

## Grouped Column

To render a time series chart with the grouped column, set the value of `plottype` attribute to `column` and the value of the `plot` attribute in the series name.

Let’s create a chart showcasing **Sales Analysis of Grocery and Footwear Store**.

{% embed_ftChart grouped-column-chart %}

## Area

To render a time series chart with **area** as data plot, set the value of `type` attribute to `area`.

A time series chart, rendered with area plot is shown below:

{% embed_ftChart online-sales-single-series-area-data-plot %}

You can also use negative values on area plots:

{% embed_ftChart positive-negative-values-area-data-plot %}

## Stacked Area

To render a time series chart with the stacked area as data plot, set the value of `type` attribute to `area` and the value of the `series` to the y-axis value.

Let’s create a chart showcasing **total rainfall of Assam and Tripura**. The time series chart looks like:

{% embed_ftChart stacked-area-chart %}

## Smooth Area

To render a time series chart with the smooth area as data plot, set the value of `type` attribute to `smooth-area`.

Let’s create a chart showcasing **daily visitors count of a website**. The time series chart looks like:

{% embed_ftChart smooth-area-chart %}

## Spline

To render a time series chart with **spline** as data plot, set the value of `type` attribute to `smooth-line`.

Let's create a chart showcasing weather report. The time series chart looks like:

{% embed_ftChart weather-report-spline-data-plot %}

## Step-line

To render a time series chart with **step-line** as data plot, set the value of `type` attribute to `step-line`.

Let's create a chart showcasing weather report. The time series chart looks like:

{% embed_ftChart weather-report-step-line-data-plot %}

## Candlestick

To render a time series chart with **candlestick** as data plot, set the value of `type` attribute to `candlestick`.

Let's create a chart showing Apple Inc. Stock Price. The time series chart looks like:

{% embed_ftChart apple-stock-price-candlestick-data-plot %}

## OHLC

To render a time series chart with **ohlc** as data plot, set the value of `type` attribute to `ohlc`.

Let's create a chart showing NASDAQ Composite Index. The time series chart looks like:

{% embed_ftChart composite-index-ohlc-data-plot %}

## Range Series Charts

FusionTime allows you to plot range series charts using time series data. The charts can be of two types:

- Column-range
- Area-range

### Column-Range Series Charts

A column-range series chart shows a series of columns parallel to one another running along its length. The average line of the range is shown in the time navigator.

A column-range chart looks as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart column-range-series-chart %}

### Area-Range Series Charts

An area-range series chart looks like an area chart bound by two lines along its entire length - one above the plot, and the other below it. The average line of the range is shown in the time navigator.

An area-range chart looks as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart column-range-series-chart1 %}

## Style Definition

You can add CSS styling to set the cosmetic properties of the data plots. To set the styling, instead of creating a separate CSS file, you can define the styling using `StyleDefinition` object or setting the style object in a particular object of the component.

Applying CSS styling to the data plots of the chart is a bit different from the other components. Although the `style` object supports any of the SVG attributes, the color of the data plots cannot be changed from their `style` sections. The color can be customized using the `paletteColors` attribute within the `chart` object.

Data plots can either be styled:

- using **plot configuration**

- or by **y-axis configuration**

### Plot Configuration

Style defined using `plotConfig` object are scoped to the entire chart, i.e., if you define a line plot and set the value of `stroke-width` to 4, all the line plots in the chart will have stroke width set to 4 pixels.

**Syntax**:

```javascript
{
  "plotConfig": {...}
}
```

You can also apply style across all the chart types using `generic` object within the `plotConfig` object. It applies the style to any chart type even in multiple canvases.

**Syntax**:

```javascript
{
  "plotConfig": {
    "style": {
      "generic": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

All the supported chart types of time-series chart can be customized using the `plotConfig` object. In FusionTime, some of the data plots have been build using several elements, for example, an area plot is built using a line at the top and the filled space is the area of the plot. Each element of the data plot can be styled individually.

Example:

<img src="{% site.BASE_URL %}/images/area-chart-three-elements.png" alt="Time Axis" width="700" height="420">

In the above image, as you can see an area chart with three elements, a line, an area, and an anchor. You can either style them individually or style them all together.

Let's take an example of an area chart where you want to customize the opacity of the above three elements with different values. The code looks like as shown below:

```javascript
{
  "plotConfig": {
    "style": {
      "area": {
        "line": {
          "opacity": 1.0
        },
        "area": {
          "opacity": 0.3
        },
        "anchor": {
          "opacity": 0.7
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

However, instead of three different values, you want to set the same value for the above chart. Let's see how can you update the same value to all the elements of the area chart:

```javascript
{
  "area": {
    "plot": {
      "opacity": 0.7
    }
  }
}
```

In the above code, the **opacity** of the line, area and anchors has been set to **0.7**.

The list of all the plot types and their respective sub-parts are listed below:

```javascript
{
  "plotConfig": {
    "style": {
      "column": {
        "plot": Style,
        "column": Style
      },
      "line": {
        "plot": Style,
        "line": Style
      },
      "smooth-line": {
        "plot": Style,
        "line": Style
      },
      "step-line": {
        "plot": Style,
        "line": Style
      },
      "area": {
        "plot": Style,
        "line": Style,
        "area": Style
      },
      "smooth-area": {
        "plot": Style,
        "line": Style,
        "area": Style
      },
      "step-area": {
        "plot": Style,
        "line": Style,
        "area": Style
      },
      "candlestick": {
        "bear": Style,
        "bull": Style
      },
      "ohlc": {
        "bear": Style,
        "bull": Style
      },
      "generic": {
        "plot": Style,
        "line": Style,
        "area": Style,
        "bear": Style,
        "bull": Style,
        "column": Style,
        "anchor": Style
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Color individual data plots

You can specify a custom color for each data plot. Specify your custom palette for data plots by providing a list of hex colors using the `paletteColors` attribute.

**Syntax**:

```json
 {
    name: "Date",
    type: "date",
    format: "%-d/%-m/%Y"
  },
  {
    name: "Low",
    paletteColor: "#2600EE",
    type: "number"
  },
  {
    name: "High",
    paletteColor: "#2632EE",
    type: "number"
  },
  {
    name: "Mean",

    type: "number"
  }
```

### Y-axis Configuration

In FusionTime, you can also style specific data plots. These styling will be scoped to only the set of plots for which the style has been defined. In the `yAxis` object the `style` object is defined under the `plot` object. The rest of the steps are the same as the plot configuration method.

**Syntax**:

```javascript
{
  "yAxis": [{
    "plot": [{
      "style": { /* bear, bull, plot, ... */ }
    }]
  }]
}
```
