A Reference Line is essentially an arbitrary fixed line, which runs parallel to the time axis and is mapped to a specific value of Y-axis. It can help you quickly compare any data point against a line representing a fixed value.

Refer to the image below:

<img src="{% site.BASE_URL %}/images/fusiontime-component-reference-line.png" alt="Reference Line" width="700" height="420">

The salient features of the reference line:

- A `label` which is by default displayed on the opposite side of the Y-axis, when you hover on the knob of the reference line.
- A `value` is by default displayed in the reflect tag when you hover on the knob of the reference line.
- A reference line can be customized in terms of shape, size, color, etc.

A chart with a reference line is shown below:

In the example given above, a reference line appears, parallel to the time axis. Hover on the knob of the reference line to see the label and the value.

## Add a Reference Line

You can add a reference line using the following attributes of the `referenceLine` object inside the `yAxis` object:

- Use the `value` attribute to set the value at which the reference line should appear.
- Use the `label` attribute to set the text of the label.

Refer to the code given below:

```javascript
{
      data: dataStore,
      styleDefinition: {
        "colorstyle": {
            "fill": "#ffff00" //color of the reference line
        }
    },
    chart: {
    },
    caption: {
        text: 'Online Sales of a SuperStore in the US'
    },
    yAxis: {
        "plot": {
            "value": "Sales",
            "type": "line"
        },
        "referenceLine": [{
            "label": "Daily Target",
            "value": 300,
            style: {
                text: "colorstyle",
                marker: "colorstyle"
            }
        }],
    }
    }
```

## Reference Line in Multivariate chart

For multivariate charts, each chart canvas can have its own reference line. A chart with reference lines in each canvas is shown below:

{% embed_ftChart reference-line-in-multivariate-chart %}

See it live! Click [here](https://jsfiddle.net/fusioncharts/1qdLorea/).

The code to render reference lines in each canvas is given below:

```javascript
{
    data: dataStore,
    caption: {
        text: 'Pollution Control Report'
    },
    yAxis: [{
        plot: 'Temperature',
        title: 'Temperature (in °C)',
        referenceLine: [{
            label: 'Controlled Temperature',
            value: '6'
        }]
    }, {
        plot: 'Carbon mono-oxide',
        title: 'CO (in µg/m³)',
        referenceLine: [{
            label: 'Controlled Carbon mono-oxide',
            value: '3'
        }]
    }],
}
```

In the above code, the reference line is set for both the canvases of the chart.

## Multiple Reference Lines

In FusionTime, each chart canvas can have endless reference lines. A chart with multiple reference lines on a canvas is shown below:

{% embed_ftChart multiple-reference-line-in-a-chart %}

Click [here](https://jsfiddle.net/fusioncharts/ymgsv027/) to edit the above chart.

The code to render multiple reference lines in a canvas is shown below:

```javascript
{
    data: dataStore,
    caption: {
        text: 'Pollution Control Report of China Town'
    },
    yAxis: [{
        plot: [{
            value: 'NMHC'
        }, {
            value: 'Nitrogen dioxide'
        }],
        title: 'Pollutants Concentration (in µg/m³)',
        referenceLine: [{
            label: 'Controlled NMHC',
            value: '150',
            style: {
                marker: {
                    fill: '#A4A7D5',
                    stroke: '#A4A7D5'
                }
            }
        }, {
            label: 'Controlled NO₂',
            value: '80',
            style: {
                marker: {
                    fill: '#87DEDB',
                    stroke: '#87DEDB'
                }
            }
        }]
    }],
}
```

## Customize Reference Line

You can use CSS styling to set the cosmetic properties of a reference line. To set the styling, instead of creating a separate CSS file, define the style properties in the `StyleDefinition` object.

### Customize the Line Color

You can customize the color of the reference line by defining the `styleDefinition` object and set the color in an object. The code is shown below:

```javascript
styleDefinition: {
    "styleReferenceLine": {
        "fill": "#ff0000"
    }
}
```

> In order to help you understand better, we have named the object as `styleReferenceLine`. You can rename the object as per your choice.

After defining the `StyleDefinition`, use the `styleReferenceLine` as the value of the `stroke` property within the `referenceLine` object to customize the cosmetic properties of the reference line.

Refer to the code below:

```javascript
{
    data: dataStore,
    styleDefinition: {
        "colorstyle": {
            "fill": "#ffff00" //color of the reference line
        }
    },
    chart: {
    },
    caption: {
        text: 'Online Sales of a SuperStore in the US'
    },
    yAxis: {
        "plot": {
            "value": "Sales",
            "type": "line"
        },
        "referenceLine": [{
            "label": "Daily Target",
            "value": 300,
            style: {
                text: "colorstyle",
                marker: "colorstyle"
            }
        }],
    }
}
```

In the above code, `styleReferenceLine` is called to set the color of the reference line.

The chart after applying the above attributes will look like as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart online-sales-single-series-column-data-plot-reference-line-style-definition %}

Click [here](https://jsfiddle.net/fusioncharts/Lut0752a/) to edit the above chart.

### Style Reference Line

You can render the reference lines as dashed lines, instead of the default continuous lines. To do so follow the steps given below:

- Set the `stroke-dash` attribute within the style object.

- To change the width of the dashed lines, set the `stroke-width` attribute in pixels.

- To set the transparency of the dashed lines, set the `stroke-opacity` attribute.

Refer to the code given below:

```javascript
{
    data: dataStore,
    caption: {
        text: 'Temperature readings of an Italian Town'
    },
    yAxis: [{
        plot: 'Temperature',
        title: 'Temperature',
        format:{
            suffix: '°C',
        },
        referenceLine: [{
            label: 'Controlled Temperature',
            value: '10',
            style: {
                marker: {
                    'stroke-dasharray': '4 3'
                }
            }
        }]
    }],
}
```

A chart with a dashed reference line looks as shown below:

{% embed_ftChart dashed-reference-line-in-a-chart %}

Click [here](https://jsfiddle.net/fusioncharts/2yhbj6fx/) to see a live chart with a dashed reference line.

In the above example:

- The reference line has been rendered as dashed. The length of the dash has been set to `4` whereas the dash gap has been set to `3`.
- The width of the dashed lines has been set to `4px`.
