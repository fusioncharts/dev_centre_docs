## Shown below is a code snippet that shows you how to get a SVG string from a chart

Using FusionCharts Suite XT you can easily get the SVG string of any chart using the `getSVGString` method. Shown below is a chart that displays the SVG string of a chart when the button is clicked.

{% embed_chart get-svg-representation-of-a-chart-example-1.js %}

Shown below is a code snippet that shows you how to get a SVG string from a chart.

```javascript
	var svgString = revenueChart.getSVGString();
```

Here the chart reference is stored in `revenueChart` and the svgString variable contains the SVG representation of the chart.

Alternatively you can also download a SVG file of your chart using the export functionality. You must enable the export feature using the exportEnabled attribute at the chart level like this

```javascript
	"exportEnabled" : "1"
```


You will see a list of options when you click on the icon on the top right of the screen, one of them being Download as SVG vector image.
