It is essential to remove content that is no longer used from a page. It helps keep memory consumption to a minimum and keeps the UI smooth even when there are several elements on the page.

Chart objects created as part of FusionCharts Suite XT support the `dispose` method, this completely cleans the memory space and all references to the chart and its data are removed.

This is how you can use the method on a chart object `revenueChart`.

```javascript
	revenueChart.dispose();
```

Shown below is a simple column 2D chart that is disposed at runtime when a button is clicked.
