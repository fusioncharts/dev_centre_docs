FusionCharts Suite XT includes the FusionCharts PHP wrapper that lets you create interactive, data-driven charts in your PHP website without writing any JavaScript code.

JavaScript and HTML code is used to generate charts in the browsers. The server-side PHP wrapper generates the required JavaScript and HTML code as a string, which is then used to render charts.

## Download

FusionCharts PHP Wrapper can be downloaded from [here](https://www.fusioncharts.com/php-charts/).

## Install

To work with FusionCharts PHP wrapper, follow the steps given below:

* After downloading the wrapper, unzip the archive and move to `wrappers 2/php-wrapper/` to get the main class file `fusioncharts.php`.

* Include `fusioncharts.php` in your project.

* Start using the methods and classes available under the fusioncharts.charts namespace to generate charts in your project.

> FusionCharts JS libraries should already be installed within your project to work with this wrapper.
