You can use FusionCharts Suite XT to configure standard interactivity for items like markers, tooltips and legend, through the map attributes itself. However, if you need to extend this further, you can tap into the JavaScript events raised by each map, and then build your custom behavior over it. You can listen to events related to `entities `, `markers`, and `connectors`, which are specific to maps. You can also use these events to  tightly integrate maps with your own applications and add interactivity to your visualizations.

## Listen to entity events

Entities in FusionCharts Suite XT can raise 3 events - `entityRollOver`, `entityRollOut`, and `entityClicked`. Here's how you can use them:

* Create a World Population map, just like you did earlier in the <Simple Data Driven Maps> section, and set its theme to `fusion`.

* Define event listeners in an `events` object as part of the `FusionCharts()` constructor to listen to 3 events. This is the quickest way to define event listeners for a map. Alternatively, you can use the `addEventListener()` method on specific map instances, or on all maps globally, to listen to events.

* Each event generated by FusionCharts Suite XT has a string event-alias for ease of use. The 3 events that you need to listen to, are:

    * `entityRollOver`, which is fired whenever you move the mouse pointer into the entity of a map.

    * `entityRollOut`, which is fired whenever you move the mouse pointer out of the entity of a map.

    * `entityClick`, which is fired, whenever you click on an entity.

* To each event listener method, you need to provide two standard argument objects - `eventObject` and `argumentsObject`, whenever you invoke the event. 

* Within the methods, you need to use JavaScript functions to hide and show the text based on user mouse interactions in the `message` textarea. You can get the label of rolled-over entity using `data.label` and the population using `data.value`.

* Reset the message with placeholder text showing the total population when the roll out event is triggered. Configure an alert, which will display information on which entity has been clicked, whenever the click event triggers.

Refer to the data structure given below:

```json
{
    "chart": {
        "caption": "Global Population",
        "theme": "fusion",
        "formatNumberScale": "0",
        "numberSuffix": "M",
        "showLabels": "1",
        "showToolTip": "0"
    },
    "colorrange": {
        "color": [{
            "minvalue": "0",
            "maxvalue": "100",
            "code": "#D0DFA3",
            "displayValue": "< 100M"
        }, {
            "minvalue": "100",
            "maxvalue": "500",
            "code": "#B0BF92",
            "displayValue": "100-500M"
        }, {
            "minvalue": "500",
            "maxvalue": "1000",
            "code": "#91AF64",
            "displayValue": "500M-1B"
        }, {
            "minvalue": "1000",
            "maxvalue": "5000",
            "code": "#A9FF8D",
            "displayValue": "> 1B"
        }]
    },
    "data": [{
        "id": "NA",
        "value": "515"
    }, {
        "id": "SA",
        "value": "373"
    }, {
        "id": "AS",
        "value": "3875"
    }, {
        "id": "EU",
        "value": "727"
    }, {
        "id": "AF",
        "value": "885"
    }, {
        "id": "AU",
        "value": "32"
    }]
}
```

> The `eventObject` and `argumentsObject` within the event listener are referenced as `evt` and `data` respectively, in the above example.

## Listen to marker and connector events

You can use markers and connectors to raise events on mouse interactions, such as roll over, roll out and click, just like entities. Build the following map to try them out:

* Create an Airport Traffic map and set its theme to `fusion`.

* Define event listeners in an `events` object as part of the `FusionCharts()` constructor to listen to 3 events each for connectors and markers. Alternatively, you can use the `addEventListener()` method on specific map instances.

* Configure listeners for the following events

    * `markerRollOver` and `connectorRollOver`, which are fired when you move the mouse pointer into the marker/connector in a map.

    * `markerRollOut` and `connectorRollOut`, which are fired when you move the mouse pointer out of the marker/connector in a map.

    * `markerClick` and `connectorClick`, which are fired whenever you click on the marker/connector.

* To each event listener method, provide two standard argument objects - `eventObject` and `argumentsObject`, whenever you invoke the event. Refer to them as `evt` and `data`.

* Within these methods, use JavaScript functions to hide and show the text based on user mouse interactions in the `message` text area.

* Get the label of rolled-over marker or connector using data.label. Note that the message is reset with placeholder text when the roll out event is triggered. Also, whenever the click event is triggered, it creates an alert with details on what was clicked.
