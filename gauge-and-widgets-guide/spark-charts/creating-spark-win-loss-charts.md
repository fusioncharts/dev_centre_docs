As an example, we will create a spark win/loss chart to show the score-card of Bobby Fischer (vs. Spassky) from the World Chess Championship of 1972.

A spark win/loss chart rendered to show Bobby Fischer’s score-card looks like this:

Given below is a brief description of the attribute used to render a spark win/loss chart:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`value`</td>
    <td>It is used to show the value for a column on the spark win/loss chart. This attribute takes the values `W`, `L`, and `D`. `W` indicates win, `L` indicates loss, `D` indicates draw, e.g. W.</td>
  </tr>
