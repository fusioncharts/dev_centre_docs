As an example, we will create a spark line chart that shows the stock price fluctuations.

A spark chart created to show the stock price looks like this:

Given below is a brief description of the attribute used to create a simple spark line chart:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`value`</td>
    <td>It is used to show the numerical value for a point on the spark line chart, e.g. 40.67. This attribute belongs to the `data` object, which in turn belongs to the `dataset` object.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
