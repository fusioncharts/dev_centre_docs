A bullet graph is a variation of a bar graph and serves as a light weight replacement for dashboard gauges and meters. Bullet graphs can be used in cases where space is a constraint and other gauges or widgets cannot be used.

## Basics of Bullet Graphs

The bullet graph features a single, primary measure (for example, current year-to-date revenue), compares that measure to one or more other measures to enrich its meaning (for example, compared to a target) and displays it in the context of qualitative ranges of performance, such as poor, satisfactory, and good.

## Types of Bullet Graphs

Bullet graphs may be oriented horizontally or vertically and multiple graphs may be stacked to allow comparisons of several measures at once.

A simple horizontal bullet graph looks like this:

A simple vertical bullet graph looks like this:

In the above charts, the filled bar represents the actual value and the line represents the target value.

## Features of Bullet Graphs

Bullet graphs allow you to:

* Plot the value as a filled bar or as a dot

* Show/hide axis division values

* Show/hide the chart value

* Customize axis limits

* Customize tick marks and values

* Customize plot cosmetics

* Draw round color range bar
