This section is to talk about the new features introduced in the lates version. Filter data by specific values, or with conditional 

## Column Filter

This feature allows you to apply filters on specific columns for a better data analysis. Enable the conditional filter to use conditions and logical operations such as; equals, between, greater than , etc. to filter data. To learn more about column filters visit our [tutorial pages](/fusiongrid/tutorials-fusiongrid/column-filter).

Here is an example of a conditional column filter:

## Column Grouping

For a better data analysis, FusionGrids allows you to have multiple levels of columns in your header and the ability, if you want, to 'open and close' column groups to show and hide additional columns. Column Grouping can also be used to perform data operations directly on the group if required. To learn more about column grouping, visit our [tutorial pages](/fusiongrid/tutorials-fusiongrid/column-grouping).

Either export the entirity of the grid, or select to export with the 'view' property to only get the data present on the current grid view.

## Integration components

FusionGrid version 1.1.1 allows you to render your grids across different libraries and frameworks such as; Angular, React, and Vue.

## Column Search Filter

To help users find information quicker, FusionGris allows users to search the rows of data using a grid instance for better data analysis.
Users can search by single or multiple Columns, search by words or even by partial words by using the '*' key to help with larger searches. To learn more about column search filters for your grid, visit our [tutorial pages](/fusiongrid/tutorials-fusiongrid/search-filter).
