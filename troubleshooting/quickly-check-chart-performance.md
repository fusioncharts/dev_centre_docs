Often, you want to measure the charts rendering time in order to check its performance. Check this using the Javascript method `performance.now()`, which needs to be called on FusionCharts `beforeInitialize` and `renderComplete` API events. Make sure `animation` attribute is set to `0` while performing.

Refer to our sample [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/fusioncharts/L690pznj/ '@@open-newtab').

Note that performance of your charts varies depending on system configurations.
