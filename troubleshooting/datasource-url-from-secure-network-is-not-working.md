If you provide a secure (`https`) static link to the dataSource, make sure that the chart rendering on the web page is also secure (`https`). Otherwise, it would result in cross origin errors.

Also, since this is an asynchronous call, if you want to perform some operation after the data is loaded you need to make use of events like `dataLoaded` or `renderComplete` to execute them on loading or on rendering.
