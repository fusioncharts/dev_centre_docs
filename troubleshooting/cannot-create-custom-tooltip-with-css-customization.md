## For charts:

To modify the look and feel of the tooltip, use the `plotToolText` attribute at the chart level which supports HTML elements. For these HTML elements, you can define your own CSS.

You can use the same CSS to modify the font inside tooltip as well. Please refer to this sample [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/fusioncharts/4m5xn7ep/ '@@open-newtab').

## For maps:

In case of map, use the `entityToolText` attribute to define your CSS via HTML elements. Refer to this sample [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/fusioncharts/gcL37k98/ '@@open-newtab').
