heading: Setting Data Source Using URL
---

FusionCharts lets you pass the complete JSON/XML chart data as a static string to the `dataSource` attribute. Alternatively, you can also save the chart data in a `.json` or `.xml` file and then pass the relative URL of this file as value to the `dataSource` attribute. 

The only difference between the two methods is the value that is passed to the `dataFormat` attribute. For the first method, the `dataFormat` attribute takes `json` or `xml` as values, depending on the chart data. For the second method, the values will be `jsonurl` and `xmlurl`.

This article explains how you can set the chart data using the URL of the corresponding file using **FusionCharts PHP wrapper**.

## Load data using JSON as URL

Let's build the same revenue chart which we built in the [first example](/getting-started/react/your-first-chart-using-react) using JSON, and use a .json file as the data source.

{% embed_chartData plain-js-setting-data-using-url-example-1.js json %}

The data for this chart is represented in the table below:

| Country   | No. of Oil Reserves |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Venezuela | 290                 |
| Saudi     | 260                 |
| Canada    | 180                 |
| Iran      | 140                 |
| Russia    | 115                 |
| UAE       | 100                 |
| US        | 30                  |
| China     | 30                  |

The JSON representation for the above table looks as shown below:

```javascript
{
    // Chart Configuration
    "chart": {
        "caption": "Countries With Most Oil Reserves [2017-18]",
        "subCaption": "In MMbbl = One Million barrels",
        "xAxisName": "Country",
        "yAxisName": "Reserves (MMbbl)",
        "numberSuffix": "K",
        "theme": "fusion",
    },
    // Chart Data
    "data": [{
        "label": "Venezuela",
        "value": "290"
    }, {
        "label": "Saudi",
        "value": "260"
    }, {
        "label": "Canada",
        "value": "180"
    }, {
        "label": "Iran",
        "value": "140"
    }, {
        "label": "Russia",
        "value": "115"
    }, {
        "label": "UAE",
        "value": "100"
    }, {
        "label": "US",
        "value": "30"
    }, {
        "label": "China",
        "value": "30"
    }]
}
```

Copy this into a file, name it `oilReserves.json`, and store it in the same folder as your HTML page.

> If you are using multilingual characters in your JSON, make sure that you save the JSON data with UTF-8 encoding.

The full code of the above sample is given below:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<?php
    /* Include the `../src/fusioncharts.php` file that contains functions to embed the charts.*/
    include("../includes/fusioncharts.php");
?>
<html>

<head>
    <title>FusionCharts | Chart using data from JSON URL</title>
    <!-- FusionCharts Library -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.fusioncharts.com/fusioncharts/latest/fusioncharts.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.fusioncharts.com/fusioncharts/latest/themes/fusioncharts.theme.fusion.js"></script>
</head>

<body>

    <?php
      // chart object
      $Chart = new FusionCharts("column2d", "chart-1" , "700", "400", "chart-container", "jsonurl", "oilReserves.json");
      // Render the chart
      $Chart->render();
?>
    <h3>Chart using data from JSON URL</h3>
    <div id="chart-container">Chart will render here!</div>
</body>

</html>
```

The above chart has been rendered using the following steps:

1. Include the `fusioncharts.php` file which contains functions to embed the charts.

2. Include the necessary libraries and components using `<script>` tags. For example, `fusioncharts.js`, `fusioncharts.theme.fusion.js`.

3. Store the chart data in the JSON file.

4. Store the chart configuration in a JSON object. In the JSON object:
    * Set the chart type as `column2d`. Find the complete list of chart types with their respective alias [here](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-guide/list-of-charts).
    * Set the width and height of the chart in pixels. 
    * Set the `dataFormat` as JSON.
    * Embed the json data as the value of `dataSource`.

5. To set the datasource using URL:
    * Set the value of the `dataFormat` to **jsonurl**.
    * Set the static URL to `dataSource` to render the above chart.

6. Create a chart container to render the chart.

> When rendering your charts locally (without a web server, even if on the localhost), you will not be able to load data from XML or JSON files present on your hard-drive. This is due to security restrictions enforced by most modern browsers.

## Load data using XML as URL

The XML representation for the above chart looks as shown below:

```
<chart caption='Countries With Most Oil Reserves [2017-18] ' subcaption='In MMbbl = One Million barrels ' xaxisname='Country ' yaxisname='Reserves (MMbbl) ' numberprefix='K ' theme='fusion '>
    <set label='Venezuela ' value='290 ' />
    <set label='Saudi ' value='260 ' />
    <set label='Canada ' value='180 ' />
    <set label='Iran ' value='140 ' />
    <set label='Russia ' value='115 ' />
    <set label='UAE ' value='100 ' />
    <set label='US ' value='30 ' />
    <set label='China ' value='30 ' />
</chart>
```
Copy this into a file called `oilReserves.xml` and store it in the same folder as your HTML page.

> If you are using multilingual characters in your XML, make sure you save the XML data with UTF-8 encoding.

The full code of the above sample is:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<?php
    /* Include the `../src/fusioncharts.php` file that contains functions to embed the charts.*/
    include("../includes/fusioncharts.php");
?>

      $Chart = new FusionCharts("column2d", "chart-1" , "700", "400", "chart-container", "xmlurl", "oilReserves.xml");
      // Render the chart
      $Chart->render();
?>
    <h3>Chart using data from XML URL</h3>
    <div id="chart-container">Chart will render here!</div>

```
