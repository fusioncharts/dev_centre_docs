With FusionCharts, you can create unlimited levels of drill-down with a single data source. The parent chart contains all data â€” for the parent chart as well as all descendant (child, grandchild) charts. The links to all the descendant charts are defined in the parent chart.

You can drill-down to descendant charts by simply clicking the data plot items on the parent chart. A descendant chart can either replace the parent chart with an option to drill-up, or it can open in a new window or frame.

Assume that the __fusioncharts_phpsample__ database also includes the __City__ table that stores the population of all cities in all countries. You now need to plot a chart that shows the top 10 most populous countries and the top 10 most populous cities in these countries.

To show data at different levels of a hierarchy, we use drill-down charts. We will now see how you can create a drill-down column 2D chart based on the above scenario, the data for which will be loaded from a database.

## The chart thus rendered looks like this:

{% embed_chart adding-drill-down-using-php.js %}

To render the above chart, we need two PHP files - `country.php` and `countryDrillDown.php`. The `country.php` file creates a drill-down column 2D chart showing the most populous countries. The `countryDrillDown.php` file creates column 2D charts that show the most populous cities for the country that was selected in the parent chart.

The data structure in the `country.php` file is given below:

```php

<?php

/*Include the `fusioncharts.php` file that contains functions
  to embed the charts.
*/
  include("includes/fusioncharts.php");

  /* The following 4 code lines contain the database connection information. Alternatively, you can move these code lines to a separate file and include the file here. You can also modify this code based on your database connection.   */

   $hostdb = "localhost";  // MySQl host
   $userdb = "root";  // MySQL username
   $passdb = "";  // MySQL password
   $namedb = "fusioncharts_phpsample";  // MySQL database name

   // Establish a connection to the database
   $dbhandle = new mysqli($hostdb, $userdb, $passdb, $namedb);

   // Render an error message, to avoid abrupt failure, if the database connection parameters are incorrect
   if ($dbhandle->connect_error) {
    exit("There was an error with your connection: ".$dbhandle->connect_error);
   }

?>
