heading: Adding Drill Down using React
---

With FusionCharts, you can create unlimited levels of drill-down with a single data source. The parent chart contains all data â€” for the parent chart as well as all descendant (child, grandchild) charts. The links to all the descendant charts are defined in the parent chart.

You can drill-down to descendant charts by simply clicking the data plot items on the parent chart. A descendant chart can either replace the parent chart with an option to drill-up or it can open in a new window or frame.

### Features of the FusionCharts JavaScript Class

* Automatically creates and shows a detailed descendant chart when you click on the corresponding data plot item linked in the parent chart

* Clones all chart configuration settings from the parent chart to create the descendant charts

* Accepts specific properties for descendant charts when you configure them using the [configureLink()](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/api/fusioncharts/fusioncharts-methods#configurelink) function.

* Uses events to notify your code when a link is invoked, a link item is opened, or a link item is closed

* Supports drill-down to an unlimited number of levels

## Create drill-down charts

As an example, we will consider a simple scenario of a parent chart with a single level of drill-down.

The parent chart is a column 2D chart showing yearly sales of the top three juice flavors, over the last one year. When you click on the data plot for a particular flavor, it drills down to show a pie 2D chart showing the quarterly sales figures for that flavor.

The above chart, when rendered, looks like the following:

{% embed_chartData add-drill-down-using-react-example-1.js json %}

The full code of the above sample is given below:

export default class App extends React.Component {

Click [here](http://jsfiddle.net/fusioncharts/k7mn6j5s/) to edit the above chart.

The above chart has been rendered using the following steps:

1. Included the necessary libraries and components using `import`. For example, `react-fusioncharts`, `fusioncharts`, etc.

2. Stored the chart configuration in a JSON object. In the JSON object:
    * The chart type has been set to `column2d` for the first chart. For Column 2D chart, the alias is `column2d`. Once the data plots in the Column charts are clicked, the rendered chart is a Pie 2D chart (alias name: `pie2d`). Find the complete list of chart types with their respective alias [here](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-guide/list-of-charts).
    * The width and height of the chart has been set in pixels. 
    * The `dataFormat` is set as JSON.

3. A `DOM` element has been created and the `react-fusioncharts` component is passed directly to the **ReactDOM.render()** method.
