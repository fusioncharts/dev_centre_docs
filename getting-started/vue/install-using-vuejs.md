The `Vue-FusionCharts` wrapper lets you include FusionCharts in your Vue projects and add interactive JavaScript charts and graphs to your Vue applications. Before we start the installation process of the wrapper, some of the features of `Vue-FusionCharts` are:

* Easily create charts in JavaScript using your Vue code.
* Render charts using "props" binding. There are more than 50 props that you can use.
* Accepts data in three formats:
    - JSON
    - XML
    - A URI pointing to a file containing JSON/XML data. However, each chart/map expects data to be formatted in a specific manner, and the data you provide must comply with the required format.

In this article, we will show you how to download and install the `Vue-FusionCharts` wrapper and all the other dependencies on your system. 

## Choose your mode of installation:

You can install FusionCharts in your Vue project using any of the two modes given below:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td align="center" style="border: none !important; background-color:#f3f6f9"><a href="{% site.baseurl %}/getting-started/vue/install-using-vuejs#install-using-direct-javascript-files-2"><img width="100px" height="100px" src="{% site.baseurl %}/images/Icons_JS.svg"></a></td>
        <td align="center" style="border: none !important; background-color:#f3f6f9"><a href="{% site.baseurl %}/getting-started/vue/install-using-vuejs#include-fusioncharts-via-npm-5"><img width="100px" height="100px" src="{% site.baseurl %}/images/Icons_NPM.svg"></a></td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Install using Direct JavaScript files

In order to install and start working with `Vue-FusionCharts` you need to [download](https://www.fusioncharts.com/download/) the FusionCharts Suite XT package which contains:

* JavaScript files to render **Charts**, **Widgets** and **PowerCharts** in the `js` folder.
* JavaScript files to render maps in the `js > maps` folder.
* JavaScript files to apply themes in the `js > themes` folder.

The folder structure is shown below:

![Js Folder Structure]({% site.baseurl %}/gif/js-folder-structure.gif)

> We recommend that you copy all the files/folders from `fusioncharts-suite-xt > js` folder to your project folder.

* The download package also contains files of the `vue-fusionCharts.js` file in `fusioncharts-suite-xt > integrations > vue` folder.

The folder structure is shown below:

![Vue Js Folder]({% site.baseurl %}/gif/vue-folder-structure.gif)

Both the minified (compressed) and source (uncompressed) copies of Vue files are available in the folder. The uncompressed file `vue-fusioncharts.js` is used during development or debugging, whereas the compressed file `vue-fusioncharts.min.js` saves bandwidth and improves performance in production. The folder also contains the source map file `vue-fusioncharts.js.map`, for use when debugging with a compressed file.

> The `vue` folder in the FusionCharts Suite XT package is available from v3.13.0.

> We recommend that you copy the JavaScript files of the `vue` folder from `fusioncharts-suite-xt > integrations > vue > js` to your project folder.

Following is the list of JavaScript files present in your `fusioncharts-suite-xt > js` folder:

File Name|Description|
-|-
`fusioncharts.js`|This is the core FusionCharts library, which you need to import in all your pages where you want to generate a chart, gauge or a map.|
`fusioncharts.charts.js`|This file is required to render all charts present under FusionCharts XT. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.charts.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.widgets.js`|This file is required to render all gauges present under FusionWidgets XT. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.widgets.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.powercharts.js`|This file is required to render all charts present under PowerCharts XT. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.powercharts.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.gantt.js`|This file is required to render the Gantt chart. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.gantt.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.treemap.js`|This file is required to render the Treemap. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.treemap.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.zoomscatter.js`|This file is required to render the Zoom scatter chart. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.zoomscatter.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.zoomline.js`|This file is required to render the Zoom line charts. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.zoomline.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.overlappedbar2d.js`|This file is required to render the Overlapped Bar 2D chart. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.overlappedbar2d.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.overlappedcolumn2d.js`|This file is required to render the Overlapped Column 2D chart, present under FusionCharts XT. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.overlappedcolumn2d.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`fusioncharts.maps.js`|This file is the core map renderer file. The map definitions, however, are stored separately, as explained next. </br>**Note:** When you include `fusioncharts.js` file in your page, you do not need to include this file separately, as `fusioncharts.js` internally loads `fusioncharts.maps.js` provided they are in the same folder.|
`maps/*`|This folder contains Map Definition files required by each map to be rendered by `fusioncharts.maps.js`. To keep the download package size small, it contains only 2 maps - `fusioncharts.world.js` and `fusioncharts.usa.js`. You can download the definition files of all the 1400+ maps offered by FusionMaps XT from [here](https://www.fusioncharts.com/download/maps/definition/ '@@open-newtab'). </br>**Note:** Replace the map definition files (of v3.12.2 or older) with the latest files available in download package while upgrading to v3.13.0.|
`themes/*`|This folder contains pre-packaged themes that can be applied to charts, gauges, and maps to style them through a central FusionCharts theme files. Refer each theme with their respective `JavaScript` file names.|

To install FusionCharts Suite XT, simply copy and paste the JavaScript files from the downloaded package into your project folder.

After that, you can include the file in your web applications and start building your charts, gauges, and maps.

Create an HTML file and follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** Include [Vue](https://vuejs.org/ `@@open-newtab`) core library:

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/vue.js"></script>
```

**Step 2:** Include the `vue-fusioncharts` module:

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/vue-fusioncharts.js"></script>
```

**Step 3:** Include the FusionCharts package:

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.js"></script>
```

**Step 4 (optional):** Include the theme file.

This step is optional, the chart will render with the default theme even if the theme file is not included.

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.theme.fusion.js"></script>
```

The consolidated code is shown below:

```HTML
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Vue - FusionCharts</title>
    <!-- vue -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/vue.js"></script>
    <!-- FusionCharts -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.js"></script>
    <!-- Vue-FusionCharts -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/vue-fusioncharts.js"></script>
    <!-- Fusion Theme -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.theme.fusion.js"></script>
</head>
```

This completes the installation of FusionCharts in your application. To see how to create a chart, click [here]({% site.baseurl %}/getting-started/vue/your-first-chart-using-vuejs '@@open-newtab').

### Installing FusionMaps for your project

FusionCharts Suite XT provides **1400+** data-driven maps as a part of the FusionMaps product. 
To reduce the size of the download package, we have included the `fusioncharts.maps.js` file and only two map definition files - the **World Map**, and the **map of USA**. However, you can [download](https://www.fusioncharts.com/download/maps/definition/ '@@open-newtab') the rest the of map definition files to plot maps of those countries/regions. 

> If you are using version v3.12.2 or older, [download](https://www.fusioncharts.com/download/maps/definition/ '@@open-newtab') the latest version and replace for upgrading to the latest map definition files.

To render a map, you need the core FusionCharts library `fusioncharts.js` along with `fusioncharts.maps.js`, `vue.js`, and the map definition files as shown below:

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/vue.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.maps.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/maps/fusioncharts.world.js"></script>
```

In the above example, we’ve included the **World Map** whose map definition (path) is contained in `maps/fusioncharts.world.js`.

**Load other map definition files**

To use any other map (except **World** and **USA**) from the **1400+** maps, [download](https://www.fusioncharts.com/download/maps/definition/ '@@open-newtab') the map definition files, then copy those map files to your current `maps` folder. The map definition files are named in the `fusioncharts.[MAP_ALIAS].js` format, where MAP_ALIAS represents the country, state, or region name. 

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/maps/fusioncharts.[MAP_ALIAS].js"></script>
```

Therefore, assuming you need to render the map of California, the alias name **california** replaces **MAP_ALIAS** in the format as shown below:

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/maps/fusioncharts.california.js"></script>
```

Click [here]({% site.baseurl %}/chart-guide/getting-started/list-of-maps '@@open-newtab') to explore all the maps available in FusionMaps XT.

The consolidated code (including the `vue.js`, `fusioncharts.js` and `vue-fusioncharts.js`)  is shown below:

```HTML
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Vue - FusionCharts</title>
    <!-- vue -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/vue.js"></script>
    <!-- FusionCharts -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.js"></script>
    <!-- Vue-FusionCharts -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/vue-fusioncharts.js"></script>
    <!-- FusionMaps -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.maps.js"></script>
    <!--world -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.world.js"></script>
</head>
```

### Themes

[Themes]({% site.baseurl %}/themes/introduction-to-themes '@@open-newtab') shipped with FusionCharts Suite XT allow you to apply centralized themes to any number of charts.

In a theme file, we can centralize the following aspects of all of your charts, gauges and maps:

* Visual appearance (data plot color, font color, font size, etc.)
* Behavior (hover effects for data plots)
* Intelligence (applying different colors to the positive and negative data plots in all charts that use the theme)

The FusionCharts Suite download package also contains predefined theme files under `fusioncharts-suite-xt > js > themes` folder. The folder structure is shown below:

![Theme Folder Structure]({% site.baseurl %}/gif/theme-folder-structure.gif)

To add a theme to your chart, include its corresponding JavaScript file in your HTML page as shown in the code below:

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/fusioncharts.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/local/themes/fusioncharts.theme.fusion.js"></script>
```

> Only including the `fusioncharts.theme.fusion.js` file will not apply the theme. To apply the theme, set the value of `theme` attribute to the respective name of the theme. For more details click [here]({% site.baseurl %}/themes/introduction-to-themes '@@open-newtab').

## Include FusionCharts via npm

The `fusioncharts` package contains files for all charts and widgets and only two map definition files, for the **World map** and the **USA map**.

This section outlines the steps to be executed for installing all the node modules via npm and rendering charts using the **vue-fusioncharts** component.


**Step 1:** Install the `vue-fusioncharts` module via npm

```PowerShell
$ npm install vue-fusioncharts --save
```

**Step 2:** Install `fusioncharts` package

```PowerShell
$ npm install fusioncharts --save
```

**Step 3:** Include the `vue` component

```JavaScript
import Vue from 'vue';
```

**Step 4:** Include 'vue-fusioncharts' component

```JavaScript
import VueFusionCharts from 'vue-fusioncharts';
```

**Step 5:** Include `fusioncharts` core library

```JavaScript
import FusionCharts from 'fusioncharts/core';
```

**Step 6:** Include specific chart modules

```JavaScript
import Column2D from 'fusioncharts/viz/column2d';
```

**Step 7:** Register the **VueFusionCharts** component:

**Globally**

In your JavaScript code, use the `Vue.use()` method to register the vue-fusioncharts component globally. This allows you to use them in the template of any root Vue instance created after registration.

```JavaScript
Vue.use(VueFusionCharts, FusionCharts, Column2D);
```

**Locally**

Registering components globally ensures that even if you want to stop using them, they will be a part of your final build. This results in an increase in JavaScript code that the users have to download. To avoid bloated code, we recommend registering the component locally.

In your JavaScript code, use the `Vue.component()` method to register the `vue-fusioncharts` component locally. Use `Vue.component()` instead of `Vue.use()`, the rest of the code remains same. Refer to the code below:

```JavaScript
Vue.component('fusioncharts', VueFusionCharts, FusionCharts, Column2D);
```

The consolidated code is shown below:

```JavaScript
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueFusionCharts from 'vue-fusioncharts';
import FusionCharts from 'fusioncharts/core';
import Column2D from 'fusioncharts/viz/column2d'

// Register VueFusionCharts component
Vue.use(VueFusionCharts, FusionCharts, Column2D)

var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
        width: '700',
        height: '400',
        type: 'column2d',
        dataFormat: 'json',
        dataSource: {
          "chart": {
              "caption": "Countries With Most Oil Reserves [2017-18]",
              "subCaption": "In MMbbl = One Million barrels",
              "xAxisName": "Country",
              "yAxisName": "Reserves (MMbbl)",
              "numberSuffix": "K",
              "theme": "fusion"
          },
          "data": [{
              "label": "Venezuela",
              "value": "290"
          }, {
              "label": "Saudi",
              "value": "260"
          }, {
              "label": "Canada",
              "value": "180"
          }, {
              "label": "Iran",
              "value": "140"
          }, {
              "label": "Russia",
              "value": "115"
          }, {
              "label": "UAE",
              "value": "100"
          }, {
              "label": "US",
              "value": "30"
          }, {
              "label": "China",
              "value": "30"
          }]
      }
    }
});
```

The HTML template to render the chart is given below:

```HTML
<div id="app">
    <fusioncharts
    :type="type"
    :width="width"
    :height="height"
    :dataFormat="dataFormat"
    :dataSource="dataSource"
    ></fusioncharts>
</div>
```

### Include Maps via npm

The `fusioncharts` package contains only two map definition files in `fusioncharts/maps` directory, the **World Map** and the **Map of USA**. This is done to keep the package lightweight. To use any of these two map definition files, follow the steps given below:

**Step 1:** Load `fusioncharts` module

```JavaScript
import FusionCharts from 'fusioncharts/core'
```

**Step 2:** Load the `FusionMaps` renderer and the map definition file


```JavaScript
import FusionMaps from 'fusioncharts/maps';
import World from 'fusioncharts/maps/es/fusioncharts.world';
```
**Step 3:** Register the **VueFusionCharts** component:

**Globally**

In your JavaScript code, use the `Vue.use()` method to register the vue-fusioncharts component globally. Registering the component globally allows you to use them in the template of any root Vue instance created after registration.

```JavaScript
Vue.use(VueFusionCharts, FusionCharts, FusionMaps, World);
```

**Locally**

Registering components globally ensures that even if you want to stop using them, they will be a part of your final build. This results in an increase in JavaScript code that the users have to download. To avoid bloated code, we recommend registering the component locally.

In your JavaScript code, use the `Vue.component()` method to register the vue-fusioncharts component locally. To register locally, use `Vue.component()` instead of `Vue.use()`, the rest of the code remains same. Refer to the code below:

```JavaScript
Vue.component('fusioncharts', VueFusionCharts, FusionCharts, FusionMaps, World);
```


The consolidated code to render the **World** map is shown below:

```JavaScript
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueFusionCharts from 'vue-fusioncharts';
import FusionCharts from 'fusioncharts/core';
import FusionMaps from 'fusioncharts/maps';
import World from 'fusionmaps/maps/es/fusioncharts.world';

// Register VueFusionCharts component
Vue.use(VueFusionCharts, FusionCharts, Maps, World)

var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
        width: '800',
        height: '550',
        type: 'world',
        dataFormat: 'json',
        dataSource: {
            // Map Configuration
            "chart": {
                "caption": "Average Annual Population Growth",
                "subcaption": " 1955-2015",
                "numbersuffix": "%",
                "includevalueinlabels": "1",
                "labelsepchar": ": ",
                "entityFillHoverColor": "#FFF9C4",
                "theme": "fusion"
            },
            // Aesthetics; ranges synced with the slider
            "colorrange": {
                "minvalue": "0",
                "code": "#FFE0B2",
                "gradient": "1",
                "color": [{
                    "minvalue": "0.5",
                    "maxvalue": "1.0",
                    "color": "#FFD74D"
                }, {
                    "minvalue": "1.0",
                    "maxvalue": "2.0",
                    "color": "#FB8C00"
                }, {
                    "minvalue": "2.0",
                    "maxvalue": "3.0",
                    "color": "#E65100"
                }]
            },
            // Source data as JSON --> id represents countries of world.
            "data": [{
                "id": "NA",
                "value": ".82",
                "showLabel": "1"
            }, {
                "id": "SA",
                "value": "2.04",
                "showLabel": "1"
            }, {
                "id": "AS",
                "value": "1.78",
                "showLabel": "1"
            }, {
                "id": "EU",
                "value": ".40",
                "showLabel": "1"
            }, {
                "id": "AF",
                "value": "2.58",
                "showLabel": "1"
            }, {
                "id": "AU",
                "value": "1.30",
                "showLabel": "1"
            }]
        }
    }
});
```

The HTML template to render the map is given below:

```HTML
<div id="app">
    <fusioncharts
    :type="type"
    :width="width"
    :height="height"
    :dataFormat="dataFormat"
    :dataSource="dataSource"
    ></fusioncharts>
</div>
```

**Load other map definition files**

You can use the remaining map files, other than the **World Map** and the **Map of USA** that are shipped with the `fusioncharts` package. To do this, install the `fusionmaps` package which contains all the map definition files, as shown below:

**Install the `fusionmaps` package**

```Shell
$ npm install fusionmaps
```

Once the `fusionmaps` package is installed you will find all the map definition files in `fusionmaps/maps/es` folder. 

> The `fusionmaps` package is dependent on the `fusioncharts` package. Therefore, to use FusionMaps, it is necessary to first include `fusioncharts` and the map renderer as shown below:

```JavaScript
import FusionCharts from 'fusioncharts/core'
import FusionMaps from 'fusioncharts/maps';
```

Load the map definition file(s) from the `fusionmaps` package for the map(s) to be rendered using the format: **fusioncharts.&lt;MAP_ALIAS&gt;**.  

Click [here](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/getting-started/list-of-maps.html) to get the alias names for all map definition files. 

Therefore, assuming you need to render the map of California, the alias name **california** replaces **MAP_ALIAS** in the format. So, the complete format will be `fusioncharts.california`.

```JavaScript
import FusionCharts from 'fusioncharts/core';
import FusionMaps from 'fusioncharts/maps';
import California from 'fusionmaps/maps/es/fusioncharts.california';
```

Register the **VueFusionCharts** component:

**Globally**

In your JavaScript code, use the `Vue.use()` method to register the `vue-fusioncharts` component globally. This allows you to use them in the template of any root Vue instance created after registration.

```JavaScript
Vue.use(VueFusionCharts, FusionCharts, FusionMaps, California);
```

**Locally**

Registering components globally ensures that even if you want to stop using them, they will be a part of your final build. This increases the JavaScript code that users have to download. To avoid bloated code, we recommend registering the component locally.

In your JavaScript code, use the `Vue.component()` method to register the `vue-fusioncharts` component locally. Use `Vue.component()` instead of `Vue.use()`, the rest of the code remains same. Refer to the code below:

```JavaScript
Vue.component('fusioncharts', VueFusionCharts, FusionCharts, FusionMaps, California);
```

> It is mandatory to include the map definition files for all maps that you want to render in your application. Unlike the core files stored in the `fusioncharts` directory, all map definition files are stored in the `maps` directory and are fetched from there.

### Include Themes via npm

[Themes]({% site.baseurl %}/themes/introduction-to-themes '@@open-newtab') shipped with FusionCharts Suite XT allow you to apply centralized themes to any number of charts.

In a theme file, we can centralize the following aspects of all of your charts, gauges and maps:

* Visual appearance (data plot color, font color, font size, etc.)
* Behavior (hover effects for data plots)
* Intelligence (applying different colors to the positive and negative data plots in all charts that use the theme)

To include the definition files placed in **fusioncharts/themes**, follow the steps shown below:

In your JavaScript code, use the `Vue.use()` method to register the `vue-fusioncharts` component.

**Step 1:** Include the core FusionCharts files

```JavaScript
import FusionCharts from 'fusioncharts/core'
```

**Step 2:** Include the theme file

```JavaScript
import FusionTheme from 'fusioncharts/themes/es/fusioncharts.theme.fusion'
```

**Step 3:** Register the **VueFusionCharts** component:

**Globally**

```JavaScript
Vue.use(VueFusionCharts, FusionCharts, FusionTheme);
```

**Locally**

```JavaScript
Vue.component('fusioncharts', VueFusionCharts, FusionCharts, FusionTheme);
```

> Only including the `fusioncharts.theme.fusion.js` file will not apply the theme. To apply the theme, set the value of `theme` attribute to the respective name of the theme. For more details click [here]({% site.baseurl %}/themes/introduction-to-themes '@@open-newtab').
