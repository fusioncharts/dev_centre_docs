## Take a look at the Column 2D chart shown below:

Events are signals that let you execute specific actions—such as manipulating the DOM, sending data to the server, and so on—using JavaScript, in response to any interactions/updates for a chart. Events can be used to trigger action(s) when a chart renders successfully, when data completes loading, when a data plot is clicked, when the mouse pointer is hovered over a data plot, and so on.

Events can be used for applications like monitoring the state of a system or a business. For example, you can listen to an event to observe the temperature of a deep freezer and display an alert message if the temperature falls below the minimum value.

Take a look at the Column 2D chart shown below:

{% embed_chart advanced-charting-events-introduction-example-1.js %}

Roll the mouse pointer over any one data plot and see how the text (the data label and the value) rendered below the chart changes.

For example, if you roll the mouse pointer over the __Canada__ data plot, the following text is displayed below the chart:

**You are currently hovering over Canada whose value is 180**

The full code of the above sample is given below:

```
//Including Vue
import Vue from 'vue';

// Include the vue-fusioncharts component
import VueFusionCharts from 'vue-fusioncharts';

//Include the FusionCharts library
import FusionCharts from 'fusioncharts';

//Include the chart type
import Charts from 'fusioncharts/fusioncharts.charts';

//import the theme
import FusionTheme from 'fusioncharts/themes/fusioncharts.theme.fusion';

// register VueFusionCharts component
Vue.use(VueFusionCharts, FusionCharts, Charts, FusionTheme)

var app = new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    data: {
        width: '700',
        height: '400',
        type: 'column2d',
        dataFormat: 'json',
        dataSource: {
            // Chart Configuration
            "chart": {
                "caption": "Countries With Most Oil Reserves [2017-18]",
                "subCaption": "In MMbbl = One Million barrels",
                "xAxisName": "Country",
                "yAxisName": "Reserves (MMbbl)",
                "numberSuffix": "K",
                "theme": "fusion",
            },
            // Chart Data
            "data": [{
                "label": "Venezuela",
                "value": "290"
            }, {
                "label": "Saudi",
                "value": "260"
            }, {
                "label": "Canada",
                "value": "180"
            }, {
                "label": "Iran",
                "value": "140"
            }, {
                "label": "Russia",
                "value": "115"
            }, {
                "label": "UAE",
                "value": "100"
            }, {
                "label": "US",
                "value": "30"
            }, {
                "label": "China",
                "value": "30"
            }]
        },
        displayValue:'Hover on the plot to see the value along with the label'
    },
    methods: {
        // uses the data info of the event 'dataplotrollover' and represents it
        dataplotRollover: function (e) {
            this.displayValue = `You are currently hovering over <strong>${e.data.categoryLabel}</strong> whose value is <strong>${e.data.displayValue}</strong>`;
        }
    }
});
```

Now, use the `fusioncharts` directive in a template. The HTML template is given below:

```
<div id="app">
    <fusioncharts
    :type="type"
    :width="width"
    :height="height"
    :dataFormat="dataFormat"
    :dataSource="dataSource"
    @dataplotRollover="dataplotRollover"
    ></fusioncharts>
    <div v-html="displayValue"></div>
</div>
```

The above chart has been rendered using the following steps:

1. Include the necessary libraries and components using `import`. For example, `vue-fusioncharts`, `fusioncharts`, etc.

2. Register `vue-fusioncharts` component.

3. Store the chart configuration in a JSON object. In the JSON object:
    * Set the chart type as `column2d`. Find the complete list of chart types with their respective alias [here](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-guide/list-of-charts).
    * Set the width and height of the chart in pixels. 
    * Set the `dataFormat` as JSON.
    * Embed the json data as the value of `dataSource`.

4. Use the `dataplotRollOver` event which is triggered when the mouse pointer is rolled over a data plot.

5. Set the **display value** when the mouse pointer rill roll over the data plots.

6. Create a `fusioncharts` directive in a template.
