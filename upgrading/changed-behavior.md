## Heat Map charts exports CSV and Excel files correctly

Exporting the Heat Map charts as a CSV or Excel file now displays correct and complete data, previously the exported files had incomplete data.

**Before the fix** Earlier, the files were exported with missing data.

## Chord Diagram exports to SVG format properly

Export a Chord Diagram to an SVG using the `getSVGString` method or via the Export Menu and see the rendered result in an SVG viewer as expected. Previously using the `getSVGString` method did not get the proper SVG strings and resulted in an error message.

**Before the fix** Unable to get the proper SVG strings which resulted in an error message when exporting with the `getSVGString` method or via the Export Menu.

**After the fix** SVG string is properly generated using both the `getSVGString` method and via the Export Menu.

## The `trendLineAlpha` attribute working properly for Trend line/zone values

The attribute `trendLineAlpha` is now working as expected and users can specify a value to configure opacity for trend line/zone values. Previously, attribute had an incorrect behavior and was not taken into account at run time.

## Box and Whisker chart exports CSV and XLSX files properly

Exporting the Box and Whisker charts as a CSV or Excel file now displays correct and complete data, previously the exported files had incomplete data.

**Before the fix** When exporting the Box and Whisker charts to CSV or XLSX files, the export API was broken and exported incomplete data, only capturing the first values provided for the individual categories.

**After the fix** The Box and Whiskers chart exports properly, displaying all properties as expected.

## Bullet graphs display tooltips properly

Bullet graphs are now improved to display tooltips for the target component even if the value property is not configured.

**Before the fix** Earlier, while plotting Bullet graphs, if the value property was not set, then the tooltip is not shown for the target component.

**After the fix** The Bullet graph always displays the tooltip for the target components, even if the property value is not previously defined.
