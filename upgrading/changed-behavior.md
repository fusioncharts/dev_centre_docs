This section is for users who are using previous version of FusionCharts in their application. Here we'll talk about the change in behavior of the charts after v3.13.0.

## Updated Options Menu

The restore button in select-scatter and drag-able chart has been moved to options menu. From v3.13.0 if you want to restore your chart, search for the restore option in the options menu at the top right corner of the canvas.

The options menu looks like shown below:

![Change Axis Limits]({% site.baseurl %}/gif/standard-charts-drag-able-charts-gif-1.gif)

Following is the list of attributes which have been replaced with new ones:

Old Attribute|New Attribute
--|--
`showFormBtn` (deprecated)|`enableSubmit`
`formBtnTitle` (deprecated)|`submitText`
`showRestoreBtn` (deprecated)|`enableRestore`
`restoreBtnTitle` (deprecated)|`restoreText`

## Inversed Data Plot

The inverse y-axis charts are similar to the normal column charts, except that the y-axis in these charts are inverted. The lower limit and upper limit value positions are swapped in the inverse y-axis chart. In v3.13.0 inverse chart comes with a new appearance, i.e., the data plots will now appear from the top of the canvas.

The new visualization of the inverse chart looks like:

{% embed_all changed-behavior-inverse-charts-example-1.js %}

> If you like to view the chart as in older version (3.12.2), contact [support@fusioncharts.com](support@fusioncharts.com).

> To view the chart as in older version(3.12.2)

## Secondary data plots overlap Primary data plots

From version 3.13.0 visualization of dual y-axis multi-series chart is changed. Now, if the data plots for both the axes are set as column, the secondary plots overlaps the primary plots.

The multi-series chart with both the data plots set as column looks like:

{% embed_all changed-behavior-multi-series-example-2.js %}
