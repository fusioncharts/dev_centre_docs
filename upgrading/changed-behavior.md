We're thrilled to unveil the latest release of FusionCharts, version 3.23.0, and FusionTime v2.9, introducing a host of enhancements designed to elevate user experience and compatibility.

A standout feature in this release is the redefined Watermark text for License Expired Customers. This update effectively restricts unauthorized usage of our product, ensuring tighter control over licensing compliance.

Key improvements include fixing inline styling functionality, resolving broken link attribute issues in zoom charts, and addressing scrolling problems with `setjsondata` or `setchartdata`. Additionally, we've incorporated 16 Japanese provinces and resolved an accessibility concern regarding Microsoft Narrator's inability to read chart plot details in specific configurations of Windows 10 and Chrome.

For additional details, kindly refer to our [changelog](https://docs.fusioncharts.com/archive/3.23.0/upgrading/change-log) and [blog post](https://www.fusioncharts.com/blog/fusioncharts-v3-23-and-fusiontime-v2-9-elevating-data-visualization-to-new-heights/).
