## New Features

* FusionCharts Suite XT v3.13.0 introduces two new chart types: **[overlapped column](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-guide/standard-charts/multi-series-charts#overlapped-column-d-chart-3)** chart and **[overlapped bar](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-guide/standard-charts/multi-series-charts#overlapped-bar-d-chart-6)** chart.

* Spline and Spline Area charts are now part of both FusionCharts XT and PowerCharts XT. 

* Spline and Spline Area charts can now be built as part of combination charts, using the `renderAs` attribute. For example, `"renderAs": "spline"`.

* A common [theme](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/api/fusioncharts/fusioncharts-properties#fusionchartsoptionsstatic-member-9) can now be applied to all charts in a page.

* In multi-level pie chart, [highlightParentPieSlices](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-attributes/?chart=multilevelpie&attribute=chart_highlightparentpieslices) and [highlightChildPieSlices](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-attributes/?chart=multilevelpie&attribute=chart_highlightChildPieSlices) attributes have been introduced to determine the direction of the highlight effect. 

* The inner radius of the multi-level pie chart can be configured explicitly using `innerRadius` attribute.

* Custom fonts from client-side export can now be exported using [useSVGDeCanvo](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/api/fusioncharts/fusioncharts-properties#fusionchartsoptionsstatic-member-9) option.

* Data from Multi-level Pie charts can now be exported in CSV or XLS formats.

* In zoomline chart, [maxPeakDataLimit](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-attributes/?chart=zoomline&attribute=chart_maxpeakdatalimit) and [minPeakDataLimit](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-attributes/?chart=zoomline&attribute=chart_minpeakdatalimit) attributes consider the limits as a range when both the attributes are used.

* [getSVGString](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/api/fusioncharts/fusioncharts-methods#getsvgstring-95) now accepts an object as the second parameter with a property named `keepImages`. It can now export the logo or any images (background images, etc.) present in the chart.

* `fusioncharts.vml.js` file has been added to the package for VML browsers which contains all the VML related codes. This file is used only when the chart will be rendered in the VML browers(IE8 and older).

* In `resized` event the `id` of the chart is added under the `dataObject`.

## Improvements

* `Angular-FusionCharts` plugin has been renamed to `AngularJS-Fusioncharts`.
* `Angular 2` and `Angular 4` plugins have been renamed to `Angular-FusionCharts`.
* The folder structure of the download package is modified. A new folder as `integrations` is added which contains all the **client-side** and **server-side** tech stacks. For more details click [here](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/upgrading/changed-behavior#updated-fusioncharts-suite-xt-download-package-5). 

* For dual y-axis charts, the secondary data plots now overlaps the primary data plots if `renderAs` attribute is set as column. If you would like the old behavior, click [here]({% site.baseurl %}/upgrading/changed-behavior#secondary-data-plots-overlap-primary-data-plots-3 '@@open-newtab') to know more.

* In order to free chart area, the restore button in select-scatter and drag-able chart has been moved to [options menu](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/chart-guide/standard-charts/drag-able-charts#dragable-column-d-chart-1). The list of attributes which have been added are as follows:

    * [enableSubmit]({% site.baseurl %}/chart-attributes/?chart=dragcolumn2d&attribute=chart_enablesubmit)

    * [submitText]({% site.baseurl %}/chart-attributes/?chart=dragcolumn2d&attribute=chart_submittext)

    * [enableRestore]({% site.baseurl %}/chart-attributes/?chart=dragcolumn2d&attribute=chart_enablerestore)

    * [restoreText]({% site.baseurl %}/chart-attributes/?chart=dragcolumn2d&attribute=chart_restoretext)

* Data plots in the [inverse chart]({% site.baseurl %}/chart-guide/standard-charts/inverse-y-axis-chart) will now appear from the top of the canvas. If you would like the old behavior, click [here]({% site.baseurl %}/upgrading/changed-behavior#inversed-data-plot-2 '@@open-newtab') to know more.

* The hyphen ( - ) character is now supported in the parameter of the JavaScript function of `link` attribute.

* The `defaultPrevented` property in the `eventObject` is used instead of the `prevented` property.

* The [onChangeCrossLine](https://www.fusioncharts.com/dev/api/fusioncharts/fusioncharts-events#onchangecrossline-287) event is fired when the mouse pointer is moved from one data plot to another.

* Gradient legend now sustains the state even on resize.

* The chart names in theme files are now case insensitive.

## Fixed

* In touch devices, tooltip was not hiding on touch outside the chart.

* The height of the chart canvas was contracting when updated using the `setChartAttribute()` function.

* Y-axis values were getting cropped when `yAxisMaxValue` attribute value was set in decimals.

* In Treemap charts, label text were overflowing and was accumulating at the corners of the chart.

* In Real-time charts, request for updated data was being sent to data source immediately after the chart was rendered, bypassing the specified update interval.

* Links were not working in funnel & pyramid charts when `enableSlicing` attribute was disabled.

* In Stacked charts that included line, such as Stacked Column 2D Line, multiple line series were considered as stacked, which led to improper axis limits.

* In Gantt charts, data table and process label column was getting displaced when their width was adjusted by dragging.

* In Pie and Doughnut charts 3D, `dataIndex` was giving wrong values from data-plot events.

* Combinations of some special characters were not getting encoded in the tooltips of real-time charts when fed from the server.

* In Stacked Area 2D charts, plots would not render properly when stacked with 100%, if there was a zero value.

* Data plots were not getting displayed in logarithmic charts if the plot values were set less than `1` or had more than 10 decimal places.

* Category labels were not drawn correctly, if padding was applied to the `<div>` tag.

* A blank XLS file was getting exported when `setChartAttribute()` method was used.

* If there were multiple charts in a page, the plot values of all charts wouldn't appear unless the rendering animation was completed for all charts.

* `feedData()` was not working, when data was fed with dial/pointer id in Angular Gauges and Horizontal Linear Gauges.

* FusionCharts was adding itself to the global window scope even if it was required using an AMD loader.

* India main map was getting tilted during rendering.

* `getCSVData()` was not returning the complete data(`id` and `value`) when plots were not selected. It was only returning the `id`.

* Experimental API `enableFirebugLite` has been removed from the Suite, as most of the browsers now have their own debugger.

* Following are the list of attributes which have been removed from the FusionCharts XT Suite:

    * `Annrenderdelay`

    * `btnTextColor`

    * `formBtnWidth`
