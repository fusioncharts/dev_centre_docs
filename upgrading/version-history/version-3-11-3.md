## Key Change

* The current pricing plan has been changed to an annual model, based on the number of developers.For more details, please visit our [pricing](https://www.fusioncharts.com/buy/) page.

## New Features

* Toolbars can now be customized using the following attributes:

    * `toolbarX`
    * `toolbarY`
    * `toolbarHAlign`
    * `toolbarYAlign`
    * `toolbarPosition`

## Improvements

* The message font and font color can now be customized when the `showChartMessage()` method is used to set custom chart messages.

* The `showChartMessage()` API is now modified to:

* `showChartMessage(text, modal, cancelable, customAttrs)` Where, `customAttrs` is an object that can take the `color`, `fontSize`, and `font` attributes as values.

* Tooltips no longer overflow out of charts. Previously, in spite of enough space being available, tooltips would flow out of charts. Now, if there is sufficient rendering space available, the tooltip is constrained to fit inside the chart.

* Trailing commas in the JS code generated by the .NET wrapper have now been removed.

* The core maps package has been updated to:

    * Update the Madhya Pradesh specification sheet to add the Agar Malwa and Ashoknagar districts.

    * Add specification sheets for 13 East Timor sub-districts under East Timor (sub-districts)

    * Add specification sheets for 14 Uzbekistan sub-provinces under Uzbekistan (sub-provinces)

    * Update the specification sheet for Russia to:

        * Rename Altai to Altaiskiy Kray

        * Add Republic of Altay, Crimea, and Sevastopol City to the list of entities

## Fixes

* Behavioral issues encountered when the `clickURL` attribute and the export event are used together have been fixed. Previously, the events would be triggered together resulting in chart export and redirection happening at the same time.

* Message log buttons are now hidden when `messageGoesToLog=0`.

* Tooltip rendering issues in the Bootstrap Modal Window have been fixed.

* For the zoomline dual y-axis chart, the traditional tooltip now includes the value of the `sNumberPrefix` attribute. Previously, when the numberPrefix and `sNumberPrefix` attributes were defined, only the value for the `numberPrefix` attribute was rendered in the tooltip.

* The *sNumberSuffix* attribute is now applied to the csv data for dual y-axis charts.

* For all Cartesian charts, when `decimals=0`, the issue of numeric values repeating for consecutive div lines along the y-axis has been fixed.

* For the pie and doughnut charts, label space management has been implemented for all valid values of the `labelFontSize` attribute. Previously, labels overlapped for larger font sizes.

* For the pie and doughnut charts, the `enableSlicing` attribute can now be used at the `data` object level to enable/disable slicing for a particular data plot. Previously, `enableSlicing` was supported only at the chart object level.

* Incorrect width calculation, when the '/' character is included in the smart label for pie and doughnut charts, has been fixed.

* For all gauges, when a data plot is clicked, the `clickURL` event is now fired only once. Previously this event was triggered twice.

* Rendering issues in gauges having low height dimension have been fixed.

* For gauges rendered with low dimensions, the scale axis now shows the upper and lower limit display values by truncating them. Previously, if there was insufficient space, the scale axis values were not rendered because numeric values cannot be truncated. This fix lets the upper and lower limit non-numeric display values to be truncated and rendered, in spite of low dimensions.

* Y-axis scaling is now done based on trend-line values, along with data values. Previously, when the trend-line values were not included, due to the difference between the largest data value and the trend-line value, the latter was often not visible on the chart.

* For server-side export, the `exported` event is now triggered as expected. Previously, the event was not triggered when `exportAction=save`.

* The `exportFormats` attribute can now be used for enabling export in selected formats. Previously, even though a single format was passed as value to this attribute, the export menu still showed all the supported formats.

* For multi-series charts, when the `plotHighlightEffect` attribute is defined, the JS error thrown upon hovering over a legend item has been fixed.

* Map color definitions are now correctly applied to entities having '0' as the data value.

* Markers no longer become unclickable when overlapped by labels.
