<h4>PowerCharts (25th February, 2009)</h4>

- **New:** DisplayValue attribute - Each data plot can now display a text value (instead of just the numeric value), allowing a sort of annotation to be rendered for each data point.

- **New:** Support for custom palettes for data point. You can now specify a list of colors that the chart will use for rendering data plots (column, pie, bar, line etc.). This allows for global configuration of palettes.

- **Improved:** Support for automatic wrapping in caption/sub-caption and tool-tips.
