## New Features

* The `forceNumberScale` (`sForceNumberScale` for the secondary y-axis) has been introduced to format values lower than the specified `numberScaleValue`.

* If a data value is less than the lowest given number is the number scale, this attribute forces the lower value of the `numberScaleUnit` to be applied to that data value. This attribute works only when `"formatNumberScale": "1"` and the `defaultNumberScale` attribute is not defined.

* The `variableIndex` attribute has been introduced to determine how the data index will be assigned to data plots in real-time charts.

## Improvements

* The `alertObj` object is now available as the second parameter of the `alertComplete` event, allowing the user more control over the event.

* The client-side export feature is now available for IE10 and above, including new Microsoft Edge browser. Also, the feature is now working correctly for gradients in Mozilla Firefox.

* In zoom-line charts, overlapping of tooltips for data plots having very close values has been fixed.

* Charts/maps with a large number of data points can now be exported using the PHP export server.

* Browser compatibility improved for handling the SVG path element in drag-node charts.

* Improved label management for funnel and pyramid charts, with a large number of data labels. Improvements include:

    * Skipping of less significant labels (determined based on label position inside the unit block)

    * Chart repositioning to display maximum label text, before label text is truncated by ellipsis

    * Optimization of the label placement algorithm to place labels based on threshold values (calculated dynamically depending on the available space)

* The following maps have been added to the core package:

    * Japan province maps

    * Azerbaijan sub-region maps

    * USA DMA maps

    * USA MSA maps

    * Europe (All Countries with UK as single entity)

## Fixes

* JavaScript Runtime error, caused by enabling recursive number scaling (`scaleRecursively=1`) for the secondary y-axis in the dual y-axis multi-series combination chart (MSCombiDY2D), has been fixed.

* All line and area charts now render correctly in IE8 when the document mode is set to `Standards` and `animation=1`.

* Previously, under these conditions, the data plots in the line and area charts would disappear after the chart finished rendering.

* Invalid `<style>` tag present in the exported SVG string has been removed.

* Interactive layers for line or area plots are now active in combination charts with a scroll. 

* Previously, the interactive layer of column data plots overlapped the interactive layer of line and area data plots.

* Maps now render correctly in IE10.

* Tooltips for individual map sections are now rendered correctly with gradient legend interactivity. 

* Previously, the tooltips disappeared when the touch event was triggered.

* Tooltips for data plots with very small values, at the base of a stacked bar chart, are now rendered correctly.

* Tooltips in charts are now working in Android Chrome for the data plots configured to listen to drag events.

* The `chartCleared` event is now triggered irrespective of where it is attached-globally, with the FusionCharts object, or at chart level. 

* Previously, the event was triggered only when attached globally.

* The `alertComplete` event is now triggered irrespective of where it is attached-globally, with the FusionCharts object, or at chart level. 

* Previously, the event was triggered only when attached globally.

* Draggable chart components, like the gradient legend, are now working correctly when the chart is rendered inside a draggable container.

* For the angular gauge, the dial value is now considered when calculating the minimum and maximum limits of the gauge scale.

* In maps, the marker label is now placed above the marker when the label is positioned in the center (`labelPos=center`).

* The LogMSColumn2D chart now renders correctly when the `showCanvasBorder` and the `showAxisLine` attributes are defined. 

* Previously, the chart failed to render even if one of these attributes was defined.

* The bulb gauge now renders correctly when `value` is undefined and the attribute `showValue=0`.

* Error shown in the Google Chrome console when FusionCharts was rendered on Windows 8 devices has been fixed.

* JavaScript error, reported in the console when a chart is disposed before the `render` event is triggered, has been fixed.

* `maxLabelHeight` attribute is now working correctly to set the maximum height for x-axis labels in real-time charts. If the height of a label is beyond this value, the label is truncated.

* The pin mode in the zoom-line chart now works correctly for all values of the `lineThickness` attribute. 

* Previously, the pin mode worked correctly only when `lineThickness=1`.

* Data values in scroll charts are now visible when a chart is configured to scroll to the end of the chart, when it is first loaded (`scrollToEnd=1`) and animation is enabled for the chart (`animation=1`).

* Number formatting issues for y-axis values in zoom-line charts have been fixed.

* Horizontal space management issues in pyramid and funnel charts have been fixed. 

* Previously, for `showLegend=1` and `legendPosition=right`, the charts would shift to the left, flowing out of the chart canvas.

* Overlapping of wrapped labels in pie and doughnut 2D/3D charts, when `manageLabelOverflow=1`, has been fixed.
