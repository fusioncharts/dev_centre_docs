## New Features

* The attribute `showChildLabels` has been introduced to control the visibility of the node labels in a treemap chart. 

* By default, the labels are hidden.

## Improvements

* 'Squarified' is now the default tiling algorithm for the treemap chart. (Therefore, by default, `algorithm=squarified`).

## Fixes

* For pie and doughnut charts that have one data value close to 100% of the total of all values, distorted rendering of the chart when smart lines are dragged has been fixed.
