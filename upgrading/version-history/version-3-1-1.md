## PowerCharts

* **New:** Ability to export charts as PNG/JPG/PDF at client side or server side. We've also devised a batch export mechanism at client side, which allows you to export all the charts in a page as a single image/PDF using one-click.

* **New:** Ability to use multi-lingual text in rotated fonts as well. We now use bitmap fonts to render all UTF-8 characters.

* **New:** Ability to specify labels for vLines and also to configure position of vLines and labels.

* **New:** Ability to copy data from chart as CSV using context menu, or JavaScript function.

* **New:** Personalization of chart - you can now add your logos over the chart, and also add an "About your company" to chart's context menu and link it to your URL

* **New:** DisplayValue attribute - Each data plot can now display a text value (instead of just the numeric value), allowing a sort of annotation to be rendered for each data point.

* **New:** Support for custom palettes for data point. You can now specify a list of colors that the chart will use for rendering data plots (column, pie, bar, line etc.). This allows for global configuration of palettes.

* **Improved:** Support for automatic wrapping in caption/sub-caption and tool-tips.

* **Improved:** More control over chart using JavaScript - many new APIs and events exposed by chart.
