## Radial Bar chart

FusionCharts Version 3.17.0 introduces the new ![Radial Bar](/chart-guide/standard-charts/radial-bar-chart) chart, part of FusionWidgets XT. Similar to a Bar chart but displayed on a polar coordinate system, and can be used for comparisons among categories by using a circular shape.

## Smart label management for Multi-level Pie chart

FusionCharts Version 3.17.0 implements smart label management for Multi-level Pie chart which automatically adjusts the data labels inside the plot avoiding labels to overlap with one another. The following attributes are included in the Multi-level Pie chart:

-  `useEllipsesWhenOverflow` (boolean) - this property converts text labels to ellipsis in order to accommodate labels in available space. The default value is true.
-  `skipOverlapLabels` (boolean) - whenever there is an overlap of labels, this property skips them to avoid congestion of labels. The default value is false.
-  `autoRotateLabels` (boolean) - this property rotates the data label text inside the data plot space. The default value is false.

## New tooltipPosition property to configure Tooltip position

FusionCharts Version 3.17 introduces the new `tooltipPosition` attribute for all charts, users now have the possibility to configure the tooltip's position with any of the following values:

-  `auto` - Tooltip position is calculated automatically. Default value.
-  `top` - Tooltip will display on the top portion of the cursor.

If it's not possible to render tooltip from user specified position then chart will revert back to auto position i.e., default value

## Included support for Plot border attributes at data series and data plot levels

FusionCharts Version 3.17.0 includes support for the following attributes at both data plot (single-series charts) and data-series (multi-series charts) levels:

-  `showPlotBorder` (boolean) - this attribute is used to show or hide the plot border and it is configurable at the chart instance, data plot, and data-series levels. When defined at data plot or at series-data levels it overwrites the value at the chart instance level.
-  `plotBorderColor` (string - inherit) - this attribute is used to specify the color for the plot border at the chart instance level. For data plot and data-series levels, users can use the inherit property as the value to be applied.
-  `plotBorderAlpha` (number) - this attribute is used to specify the opacity for the plot border at the chart instance level, data plot, and data-series levels.
-  `plotBorderThickness` (string/number) - this attribute is used to specify the thickness for the plot border at chart instance, data plot, and data-series levels.
-  `Alpha` - controls the opacity for both the plot border as well as for the plot when defined. To define a different opacity for plot border set the plotBorderAlpha property with a different value.
