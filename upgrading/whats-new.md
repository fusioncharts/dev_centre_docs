This section is for users using the previous version of FusionCharts in their application. Here, we'll talk about the new features introduced in v3.22.x.

## Blazor Integration

FusionCharts release version 3.22 introduces the Blazor integration with FusionCharts. Integrating FusionCharts with Blazor allows you to leverage the power of both technologies to create dynamic, data-driven, and highly customizable charts within your Blazor applications.

This integration combines the strengths of FusionCharts in data visualization and interactivity with Blazor's server-side and client-side capabilities, making it an ideal choice for building modern, data-centric web applications.
