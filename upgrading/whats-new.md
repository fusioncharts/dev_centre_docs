## FusionDev AI: AI-powered knowledge base and documentation assistant

FusionCharts release 4.0.0 introduces **FusionDev AI: AI-powered knowledge base and documentation assistant**.

The newly implemented assistant helps you to:

- Improve Discoverability and unblock developers by finding instant answers to questions about using FusionCharts with AI-powered context-aware documentation.
- Increase developer productivity by providing instant access to clear, concise, and up-to-date documentation, including code examples for the FusionCharts.
- Improve development efficiency with automated code generation.

To start using **FusionDev AI** just refer to the following page.

## Introducing autoUpdateStartEndDateColumn attribute: Auto-Update Actual Dates on Taskbar Drag

The newly implemented attribute `autoUpdateStartEndDateColumn`, auto-updates the actual start date / actual end date columns in the `Gantt` Chart when taskbars are getting dragged. Whenever this attribute is enabled, the data source will update the column start/end dates as well along with the taskbar position.


## Presenting allowTaskbarOverlap attribute: Enhancing User Experience

The recently adopted `allowTaskbarOverlap` attribute for `Gantt` Charts, allows users to drag the taskbar over adjacent taskbars in the `Gantt` Chart. The taskbar start and end date will not be restricted by the adjacent taskbar’s x and y positions.


## Introducing marginLeft, marginRight, marginTop, and marginBottom attributes: Numeric Milestone Setting

The newly implemented `marginLeft`, `marginRight`, `marginTop`, and `marginBottom` attributes were introduced in the milestone option of `Gantt` charts. These attributes are utilized to set the milestone as per the numeric value provided in these.
