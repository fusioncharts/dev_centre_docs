This section is for users using the previous version of FusionCharts in their application. Here, we'll talk about the new features introduced in v4.0.x.

## Elevating Project Management with Enhanced Gantt Charts

FusionCharts release 4.0.0 introduces advanced capabilities for scheduling and project management visualizations. Automatic updates minimize manual data entry errors while overlapping taskbars and customizable milestones enhance project communication.

### Introducing autoUpdateStartEndDateColumn attribute: Auto-Update Actual Dates on Taskbar Drag

The newly implemented attribute `autoUpdateStartEndDateColumn`, auto-updates the actual start date / actual end date columns in the `Gantt` Chart when taskbars are dragged. The data source will update the column start/end dates and taskbar position whenever this attribute is enabled.

### Presenting allowTaskbarOverlap attribute: Enhancing User Experience

The recently adopted `allowTaskbarOverlap` attribute for `Gantt` Charts, allows users to drag the taskbar over adjacent taskbars in the `Gantt` Chart. The taskbar start and end date will not be restricted by the adjacent taskbarâ€™s x and y positions.

### Introducing marginLeft, marginRight, marginTop, and marginBottom attributes: Numeric Milestone Setting

The newly implemented `marginLeft`, `marginRight`, `marginTop`, and `marginBottom` attributes were introduced in the milestone option of `Gantt` charts. These attributes are utilized to set the milestone as per the numeric value provided in these.
