This section is for users using the previous version of FusionCharts in their application. Here, we'll talk about the new features introduced in v4.1.x.

## Improved CSP Compliance: Enforcing Trusted Types for 'Script' with Webpack Upgrades

FusionCharts 4.1.0 improves and enhances CSP compatibility for the `require-trusted-types-for 'script'` by upgrading Webpack and related packages to their latest versions, preventing indirect script injection unless the scripts are injected using secure, trusted policies. 

Resolving `style-src` Policy Issues: Ensuring Compatibility with `Inline Styles` in **Tooltips**, `Radial Chart CSS`, and **Table Styling** for `Draggable Column 2D Charts`.

## Enhancing Waterfall Charts: Introducing a Scrollbar for Improved X-Axis Navigation

FusionCharts release 4.1.0 introduces a new scrollbar for `Waterfall` **Charts** to improve user experience and navigation through the x-axis without impacting the existing chart or layout.

This addition facilitates better user interaction with data that might otherwise overflow due to lengthy labels or an extensive range of values depicted in one axis section of the `Waterfall` chart.

## Customizable Legend Scrollbars: New Dynamic Keys for Enhanced Look and Feel Control

FusionCharts release 4.1.0 implemented advanced new dynamic keys to control the look and feel of the legend scrollbars.

The newly added attributes allow you to enable or disable shading gradient colors, giving control over the look and feel of the `Legend Scrollbars`.

## Enhanced Support for Third-Party Integrations

FusionCharts 4.1.0 enhanced support for third-party tools and libraries to ensure smoother, more secure performance:

- Updated `Ember` to the latest version for better performance.
- Refined component variables and functions in `Glimmer` components.
- Resolved `dependabot` security updates to keep the app safe.
  
These updates aim to provide a more seamless experience when integrating with third-party systems, while also maintaining high performance and security standards.
