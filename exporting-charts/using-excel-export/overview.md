FusionCharts Excel export is a new and a very powerful feature added to the FusionCharts product suite. This feature enables you to export charts rendered through FusionCharts into native Excel. You can export the chart as well as the chart data in a single space for better analysis. Unlike the charts exported as images and PDF, charts exported as excel will retain their interactivity. You will have the option to customize the chart and data as per your requirement.

FusionCharts Excel export adds an additional option, **Export As Excel**, in the existing export menu.

When the  **Export As Excel** option is clicked, as shown in the image below, an Excel file that contains the chart and the data is downloaded.
