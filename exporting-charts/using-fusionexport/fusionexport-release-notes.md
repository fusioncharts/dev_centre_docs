<p class="release-date">28th August, 2019</p>

<h4 class="sub-heading">New Feature</h4>

-  **No more External Dependencies:** In v1.1.1, we made by allowing you to download dependencies during runtime. However, this created a huge backlash as many of our customers run FusionExport behind a firewall. Hence, with this minor release, we have reverted back the change.

-  **Dealing with Incomplete FusionCharts XT Suite:** Although we know FusionCharts XT Suite is incredible. But sometimes people only use few modules of FusionCharts XT Suite. FusionExport used to break in such scenarios. We have fixed it so that you can embrace the minimalistic lifestyle.
